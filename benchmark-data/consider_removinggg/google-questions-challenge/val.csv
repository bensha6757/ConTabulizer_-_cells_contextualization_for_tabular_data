13,17,question and answer 23,Can you book hotels on a prepaid credit card worldwide?,"I tend to stay at smaller boutique hotels or local apartments when I visit a city but recently due to some credit card issues I will need to depend on prepaid Visa.  But I noticed when I try to shop online a lot of retailers don't accept prepaid credit cards so I'm thinking hotels would be even stricter.  Is there a list somewhere of countries or particular hotel chains than ban prepaid cards? If so, how does one book online or reserve a room without a card?  Do all hotels worldwide accept cash?
",verve,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/2283,"TL;DR - Depends, on your pre-paid card, the hotel, and how you book the hotel.

There are a few different charges to consider here:


Pre-payment of the room at/shortly after booking
Holding the room on a flexible booking
Deposit at checkin
Room charge, meals, drinks, extras etc at checkout


With many OTAs and hotel websites, if you make a non flexible booking, or some kinds of flexible bookings, they will charge your card for the room rate during the booking process. With some others, they'll send your card details through to the hotel, who'll put it through their tills later. (Maybe that day, maybe during a weekly sweep). In order for this pre-payment to go through, your card will need to support offline / cardholder-not-present transactions. As long as your card advertises itself as ""suitable for online shopping"" or similar, and as long as the card issuer doesn't block travel booking, you should be fine. Speak to your card issuer to be sure.

Alternately, when reserving the room, you might opt for a flexible rate where you pay at checkout, with no pre-payment. This is typically offered on the hotel's own site, and some OTAs. They will normally ask for a credit card to ""hold"" the reservation, which would be charged in the event of a no-show, but as long as you turn up as planned the card won't be charged. These rates are normally a bit more expensive than non-flexible pre-paid ones, but this style of booking should be fine on any card.

At checkin, most hotels (but not all) will want to take some sort of deposit. Typically this covers any unpaid parts of the room rate, along with expected spend in the restaurant / bar / etc. The details taken would also be used in the event of damage. If you've pre-paid the room and don't plan to run up extras in the hotel, many hotels would let you not leave a deposit, but not all. Very small hotels may take a look at you, decide you look fine, and tell you to pay everything at checkout. Some hotels may want to take something no matter what.

For the deposit, this is normally done as a pre-authorisation. Not all pre-paid card support this, which would be a problem. Some pre-paid cards do support it, but badly, and might take a week or so to release the reserved funds, which could be a problem. Check with your card issuer about this. Alternately, many hotels which require a deposit will be willing to take a cash deposit, but they may well want a larger cash deposit than they'd normally authorise on a credit card. (They can't charge extras to the card later for example). Expect to leave a hefty chunk of cash as a deposit, expect checkin to take a while, expect several people to count the money, bills may be checked for counterfeits, and expect a receipt at the end. Speak with the hotel first to see if they need a deposit, and if they take cash ones. As a datapoint, I once got stuck in a checkin queue behind someone doing a cash deposit, he was asked to leave something like 4 nights room rate as a deposit on a 2 night stay.

Finally, we have settling up the bill at the end. If you pre-paid, and didn't eat there, you could well find there's nothing to pay, or just a few dollars / pounds / euros in city taxes. Alternately, if you didn't pre pay (or they didn't take it), ate in the restaurant lots etc, you could have a decent amount to pay here. You'll be present, so any card which supports in-person transactions will be fine for this. Well, as long as you have the money on it for the bill that is! If you did a cash deposit, you should get the choice between taking the bill off that and getting the remainder, or getting the whole deposit back in cash and paying on a card.

Oh, one more possibility - charges not noticed at checkout. Maybe you forgot to tell them about the minibar charges, maybe that morning's breakfast didn't go through, something like that. If you used a credit card for the deposit, expect them to charge it to that later when they notice. If you paid cash, expect to get a bill in the mail some time later.

Can it be done - sure! Can it be done at one specific hotel with one particular kind of pre-paid card on one specific rate booked one specific way? Depends...

This would imply everything made mostly from Fe is cold iron. Clearly, this is not the case, in every game Cold Iron is something special, the every day sword is not made out of it.

  something that anyone could reasonably get access to, but usually doesn’t carry on them (like cold iron) page 185.


What is cold iron?
How do I create cold iron?
How do I get cold iron?   

To make the question easier to understand, compare Cold Iron to Holy Water. You know how it is different from usual Water, you know how you get it or create it.

Referencing your quote, how much steel do you have on you right now?  Sure, some people still carry a Leatherman or a pocket knife but most don't in the US these days.  However, how easy is it to get one?  In Summer Knight Dresden specifically mentions needing to

24,29,question and answer 41,"Relationship between user story, feature, and epic?","As someone whose still new to agile, I'm not sure I completely understand the relationship or difference between a user story, feature, and epic.

According to this question, a feature is a collection of stories.  One of the answers suggest that a feature is actually an epic.  

So are features and epics considered the same thing, which is basically a collection of related user stories?

Our project manager insists that there's a hierarchical structure:

Epic -> Features -> User stories

... basically all user stories must fall within this structure.  Therefore all user stories must fall under an umbrella feature and all features must fall under an epic.

To me, that sounds awkward.  Can someone please clarify how user stories, features, and epics are related?  Or is there an article that clearly outlines the differences?
",nivlam,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/45,"I caution you against applying too rigid a hierarchy to these terms.  We tried to do that in my previous job.  Twice.  Both attempts were different and both times we found we had unnecessarily limited ourselves.  The only constant was the definition of a User Story.  From a planning perspective, a story is the basic building block of a project.  The larger terms (epic, feature, etc.) are effectively just tags.  Tags are an easy way to allow a story to exist as part of multiple Epics and multiple Features at the same time.  It's not worth the mental effort to be more strict than that.

Tags work for Stack Exchange and they can work for you too.

",Anil Vaitla,https://stackoverflow.com/users/815977,"I think you need to read about projects and solutions: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee817674.aspx

And after that it all becomes more clear: Have one solution, inside of that solution create a project for your application and a project for your unit-tests. In test-project add reference to the testing framework of your choice and a reference to your application-project. 

This way your application does not know about your tests and compiled into one assembly. At the same time your tests depend on your application, but compiled into another assembly, which can be used by your test-runner GUI/CI or whatever else you use.

If you doing have using System.IO; in your file, the Directory class will not be found by the compiler.
The way you're specifying your path (""images/movies"") will be relative to the current working directory, which is likely not the proper directory.  You should use Server.MapPath or the Path class to build a full path to the proper folder, so you can specify the correct folder with a full, absolute path.

",Marath the commander,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/7225,"Depends on what you mean by ""misused"".

If the card was cast illegally, such as trying to Shock a creature with Hexproof, the game is rewound to the point immediately before the spell was cast. This does depend on how much time has passed- if so much time has passed that fixing it would be difficult, just correct anything currently illegal and continue the game.

If a player just did something silly, like trying to Shock a creature that actually had 3 toughness because of a Glorious Anthem, the answer is no in any tournament setting. Once you've taken an action, you can't suddenly change your mind. In casual play, it's up to the opponent. If the opponent decides it's sporting to allow take-backs, they can allow them.

58,74,question and answer 117,"Diff between backups: see permissions, group and owner and sym link differences","Question

Using only the command line, is it possible to tell if a rsync backup (on a NAS) and the original folder tree (on a web server) are exactly the same? I mean in terms of file sizes, attributes, and symbolic links?

I feat the most for symbolic links. In case of a hard-drive failure – let's say I can solve all the booting issues – will I be able to put back all the files with all the symbolic links done right and their permissions / attributes?

Context
I am setting up an rsync backup system in which my NAS (arm processor) connects to my dedicated webserver hosted far far away and does a backup of the / partition. 

In case of a disk crash, I plan on making the exact same partition setup on the new disk, on installing the same operating system (14.04) so I get the MBR / boot loader in place. 

Then I will rsync back the backup from the NAS to the server, reboot and cross my fingers.

The issue is that I will only know if everything works the day I need the backup…. But I can take measures to know if it will work before. One of them is checking that every single file, folder, sym link… in the backup has the same permissions, attributes, whatever than the original. I also need to check that the sym links and similar are correctly done.

The options I use with rsync are :

rsync -rlptgoDXvxzH --numeric-ids --exclude={""/dev/*"",""/proc/*"",""/sys/*"",""/tmp/*"",""/run/*"",""/mnt/*"",""/media/*"",""/lost+found""}


The option A is causing issues.

EDIT: ADDITIONAL INFO

What I am looking for is a working backup strategy that will allow me:

– to perform blazing fast backups.
Because I do backup the / system partition, I take most services down on the server (apache, postfix, dovecot, mysql, etc.) so I can have a safe backup. Any solution such as rsync is good, because I can update a mirror directory on the NAS. Then, offline, I can take care of the backup strategy (incremental, etc…) from the updated mirror.

– to have fast restore (I don't want to transfer a 100 GB disk image).
I have a really really fast connection between the NAS and the server. I mean really fast. Transferring a 10 GB disk image is a matter of minutes.

What I can't do: change the physical setup of the hosted server. I have one 500 GB disk. That's all.

What I can do: boot the server in a rescue mode in which the disk isn't mounted at all. Rescue mode even works with a dead disk. I use this mode to perform binary images of partitions.

Current setup: 
/     10 GB, 17 % full
SWAP 512 Mo
/var  80 GB
/bkup the rest… to 500 GB.
",Adeline,https://askubuntu.com/users/271981,"My experiment


Setup


At first I created an Ext4 Partition on my PC using gparted.

Then I booted into a small Arch GNU/Linux installation in the hope that this would bring a better performance. Then I attached my Raspberry Pi with a only a bit modified Raspbian GNU/Linux Installation via Ethernet switch to the PC.

Then I mounted the Ext4 partition. 


Copying


After this I copied the / partition of the Pi to my PC.

rsync -rlptgoDXvxzH --numeric-ids --exclude={""/dev/*"",""/proc/*"",""/sys/*"",""/tmp/*"",""/run/*"",""/mnt/*"",""/media/*"",""/lost+found""} root@raspberrypi:/ rsync_mount/


This took about 20 minutes. If you copy your server to your NAS you may need


a flatrate (or a lot of money;) )
a lot of time


bricking the Raspberry Pi



Then I bricked my Raspberry Pi using

ssh root@raspberrypi

rm -r /run /var /etc /usr


Then I had to unplug the power cable because nothing was working anymore.


repairing the Raspberry Pi


Finally I plugged the SD-Card of the Rpi into my computer, mounted it and repaired it using

cp -rpvxH  rsync_mount/* rpi_mount/


after unmounting the SD-Card and booting the Rpi everything worked fine again.

Fazit

The part with rsync worked fine, but I do not know if it will work with a complete new installation. Maybe then the kernel will not fit to what you copy back on the server.

I will make another try, where I install a newer kernel version after rsyncing.

62,78,question and answer 127,Opamp Voltage Doubler Unstable (After Extended Operation),"I've been working on a circuit which would drive an industry standard pneumatic regulator (E/P transducer).  The transducer takes a standard 0-10V command signal with a typical input impedance of 6.5 kOhms.  The DAC that I've selected (ADI 12bit 8 channel) has an internal 2.5V reference and can output 0-5V.  

After researching extensively, an opamp voltage doubler seemed like a good fit.  This worked and was rock solid for about two weeks, but failed after a ~2 day period of continuous operation without warning.  Now the opamp output is close to a correct 2.0 gain but constantly fluctuates as if the output is barely stable and poorly damped.  Has anyone ever seen an opamp fail this way?  

We're using a UA7812 linear regulator to supply 12V (from 24V) to the opamp quad (LM324AN) and admittedly it may not be sufficiently heatsinked (gets wicked hot to touch). Still, the 12V supply is solid at 11.83V and voltages supplied by the DAC appear correct and stable.  The actual resistors on the board are 10k with 0.1% accuracy and each measure 9.95k precisely.  Any advice in solving the problem is tremendously appreciated!  It's essential that this be a robust circuit.

Below is our final opamp configuration (and the part number):


",Liquid Plasmas,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/68582,"I'm just guessing but your description makes me think that the pneumatic regulator is requiring a lot more current that you think.  I base this on you saying that your 7812 regulator is running so hot.

Couple of things:

1) You don't need the regulator.  The LM324 is good for a maximum supply voltage of 34 (36?) Vdc.

2) Add an emitter follower to the output of the op-amp.  I'd be tempted to use a physically-large transistor just because of dissipation issues.  NPN, TO-220 package, gain  (Hfe) of at least 100.  Collector goes to +24V, Base comes from output of op-amp, Emitter feeds both the pneumatic regulator and the right-hand end of R34.  Note that the transistor is inside the feedback loop and doesn't introduce any error.

Question: is your regulator a voltage-input device or current-input?  My company makes interface cards like this for a variety of different actuators and the ones that we work with are all current-input devices.  We drive them with a low-frequency PWM signal where the output current is proportional to the control input.  This eliminates temperature effects on the actuator's solenoid coil and the vibration that the low-frequency PWM produces reduces stiction in the actuator.

",Souhardya Mondal,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/62308,"It is better to think of Ohm's Law as I=V/R.

What it is telling you is that if you apply a voltage (V) to a resistive material (characterised by R), then that voltage is capable of driving a current I.
The material could be anything, a piece of copper, or the plasma in a star.

The voltage is constantly supplying energy to the electrons in the material, but the resistivity is constantly taking that energy back out (converting it to thermal energy).
The higher the voltage, the more energy you can give to the electrons and hence the higher the current. On the other hand, the higher the resistance, the more energy is taken away from the electron flow and hence the lower the current.

like RJS said, I had to put the listen_addresses to accept multiple IPs. This was initially done but later on I realised that the line had a # in front of it which meant it was commented. So I took off the comment.
Even after stopping the PG server, pg_lsclusters showed that there was still a service running. So I couldn't restart it since it reported that it  was already running.
Then by using ps I found that a related program known as pgpool was using the same port and it wouldn't let the default 5432 port to be used by PG. So I stopped this from the terminal using sudo pgpool stop. 
Then I restarted the postgres server and all was fine!

While searching for an answer, I was told by a volunteer RhodiumToad on IRC (#postgresql) that pooling wasn't necessary for what I was doing. I was asked why I have it. The strange thing is that I never installed it. Perhaps pgpool was installed as some addition.
One of the other problems was that I could not get pgadmin to start up on Windows. and correctly connect. There was a libpq.dll missing. Apparently (you'll find another post on stackoverflow about this), the file was there in a few places on Win XP. So I copied all of the postgres DLL files to Windows/System32 and it fixed that.

95,122,question and answer 193,Continuations in Clojure,"I read somewhere where rich hickey said:  


  ""I think continuations might be neat
  in theory, but not in practice""


I am not familiar with clojure.
1. Does clojure have continuations?
2. If no, dont you need continuations? I have seen a lot of good examples especially from this guy. What is the alternative?
3. If yes, is there a documentation?
",unj2,https://stackoverflow.com/users/82368,"A common use of continuations is in the implementation of control structures for: returning from a function, breaking from a loop, exception handling etc. Most languages (like Java, C++ etc) provide these features as part of the core language. Some languages don't (e.g: Scheme). Instead, these languages expose continuatiions as first class objects and let the programmer define new control structures. Thus Scheme should be looked upon as a programming language toolkit, not a complete language in itself.

In Clojure, we almost never need to use continuations directly, because almost all the control structures are provided by the language/VM combination. Still, first class continuations can be a powerful tool in the hands of the competent programmer. Especially in Scheme, continuations are better than the equivalent counterparts in other languages (like the setjmp/longjmp pair in C). This article has more details on this.

BTW, it will be interesting to know how Rich Hickey justifies his opinion about continuations. Any links for that?

100,127,question and answer 202,Is it code-legal to have a circuit breaker box within a storage room?,"I am currently in the process of planning a room remodel to convert an existing bedroom into a home office and storage room.  One thing that makes this conversion a little bit tricky, is the existence of a breaker box at the rear corner of the room.

As you can see in the image below, we plan to have the back 5' of the room become a storage area (there would be 2' deep shelving units along the back wall, stopping short of the breaker box, we would use this area to store Christmas decorations, misc. stuff, etc..).  I know it is illegal to place a breaker box in a closet that will store clothes or other combustibles.  So my questions would be: 1) how would one define a storage room vs. a closet (i.e.- could this be classified as a walk in closet somehow?) and 2) with > 36"" clearance in front, and 30"" around, would this be legal?


",MarkD,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/346,"National Electrical Code (NEC) typically defines rooms and areas based on the ""intended"" use of the area. They do not provide a definition for a ""storage room"", but they do provide a definition for a ""clothes closet"".


  Clothes Closet. A non-habitable room or space intended primarily for storage of garments and apparel.


To answer the rest of your question, we'll have to take a look at Article 110.  Since section 110.26 of the NEC is a bit long, quoting the entire text here may not be considered ""fair use"" so instead I'll summarize it for you.


  National Electrical Code 2008
  
  ARTICLE 110 Requirements for Electrical Installations
  
  II. 600 Volts, Nominal, or Less
  
  110.26 Spaces About Electrical Equipment. Sufficient access and working space shall be provided and maintained about all electrical
  equipment to permit ready and safe operation and maintenance of such
  equipment.


110.26(A)(1) Depth of Working Space.
This section says the depth of Working Space must be between 3 and 4 feet, ""measured from the exposed live parts or from the enclosure or opening if the live parts are enclosed"".  In a typical residential situation, the depth of Working Space will be 3'.

110.26(A)(2) Width of Working Space.
This section says the width of Working Space must be the width of the equipment or 30"", whichever is greater. And that there should be enough Working Space to allow the equipment door to open 90 degrees.

110.26(A)(3) Height of Working Space.
The Working Space must be clear from ""the grade, floor, or platform"" to the height of 6 1/2', or the height of the equipment whichever is greater. There is an exception to this which says:


  In existing dwelling units, service equipment or panelboards that do not exceed 200 amperes shall be permitted in spaces where the headroom
  is less than 2.0 m (61⁄2 ft).


This section also says that any other equipment associated with the electrical installation""located above or below the equipment, cannot extend more than 6"" beyond the front of the equipment.


  110.26(B) Clear Spaces. Working space required by this section shall not be used for storage. When normally enclosed live parts are
  exposed for inspection or servicing, the working space, if in a
  passageway or general open space, shall be suitably guarded.


Which means the equipment can be in an area used for storage, but the Working Space cannot be used for storage. The basic idea is if you draw a box on the floor in front of the equipment 30"" wide and 36"" deep, and then extend that box up 6 1/2', you'll have your ""Working Space"". As long as you keep this Working Space clear, you should have no problems.  However, there are a few more things to consider.

110.26(C) Entrance to and Egress from Working Space.  


  110.26(C)(1) Minimum Required. At least one entrance of sufficient area shall be provided to give access to and egress from working space
  about electrical equipment.


You'll have to check local building codes to determine what the ""sufficient area"" is, and then make sure you keep this area clear too. 

Another important consideration is lighting.

110.26(D) Illumination.
This is a section that is often overlooked in residential situations, and is often satisfied simply by having lights in the room where the service panel is installed.  Personally, I take this section seriously.  I recommend installing a dedicated circuit, consisting of a single switch and a single luminaire. Then installing it just above the equipment, as to provide adequate light for anybody working on the equipment.  Putting the luminaire on a dedicated circuit allows you to deenergize other circuits, while maintaining good lighting while servicing the equipment.

It's a good idea (though a bit overkill), to also provide emergency lighting near the equipment.  Installing a simple fixture like this near the equipment, ensures that you won't have to fumble in the dark to flip breakers if the power ever goes out.



This unit can be installed on the same dedicated equipment luminaire circuit. That way even if you have to switch off the whole panel to do work, you'll still have light.



tl;dr


Keep an area 30"" wide, 36"" deep, and 6 1/2' high in front of the equipment clear (Working Space).
Provide ""sufficient area"" for entrance to and egress from the equipment (see local building codes to determine ""sufficient area"").
Make sure the area has enough lighting.
Rooms are defined by intended use.

As a sidenote, I've noticed that I use the momentum of my forearm to help apply the appropriate pressure on the string I'm trying to hit.

",jason328,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/5796,"From my experience &amp; from forum surfing, I can confidently say that your pinky finger will always be weaker than the others.  I have tried the following techniques and think that they can be used to help bridge the gap for you (aside from unfocused tapping):


Tap softer with the other fingers and tap harder with the pinky finger, slowly and cleanly.  Build up speed keeping the sound clean.
Use hand / finger grips to exercise the fingers, focusing on the pinky.  (Gripmaster, Planet Waves, Xtensor, etc.)
Use finger weights.


Place weights on pinky to make it work harder, which will in turn build strength.  Start off light, slow, and clean -- gradually increasing speed.  After a week or so, increase weight and start back slow.  You can alternate between increasing speed and or increasing weight, depending on what you want to train.


If I were you, I would invest in the finger weights.  I have found them very helpful.  You actually feel faster and stronger after playing with them on and then removing them and playing normally.

120,151,question and answer 239,Disabled buttons while long running task,"My application has a toolbar and a lot of buttons on it. Some buttons start a long running processes(tasks). At this moment every task executes asynchronously to allow user to do something else while task is executing. Thereby I have a problem: user can click the same button many times to start others same tasks. I have decided to disable button before start task and enable it after finish. Other problem, I should to protect other buttons from pressing (some of these would be disabled after done current tasks). In general, I have to disable all buttons (toolbar) to be sure that user cannot do something dangerous with buttons at transient. My questions are: 

Could someone recommend way to distract users from flickering (disable/enable buttons) or how to involve them in process, how to made them filling that task is not so long?

Maybe I should to execute tasks synchronously and disable all UI for time of execution? 

By the way:
Delay can vary from 1 to 10 sec. About progress bar: it is a difficult to calculate current progress, and it causes some performance degradation (task can be done faster without any additional UI iterations from other threads).

171,208,question and answer 332,"Superlatives with ""the""","What is the rule regarding using the with superlatives? For example:


  
  John is the fastest among his friends.
  John is fastest among his friends.
  


Both appear to be correct.   I have seen both formats in a variety of places.
",BVDL,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/10006,"Both are indeed correct. An article is only necessary in the superlative (or comparative) if the adjective is attributive (i.e. is in the same phrase as the noun it is describing).

Consider the following examples:


  
  Example #1:
  
  John is the fastest boy.
  *John is fastest boy.
  
  Example #2
  
  John is the fastest among his friends.
  John is fastest among his friends.
  
  


As is shown in the examples above, omitting the in #1 causes it to become ungrammatical, as the superlative fastest is in the same phrase as its noun boy. In #2, however, the may be freely omitted as it is not attributive.

Some English superlatives, however, use the adverb most, which can cause some amount of confusion. Consider the following examples:


  
  Mary is the most beautiful.
  Mary is most beautiful.
  Mary is a most beautiful woman.
  


All three of these examples are grammatical and show the overlap of an adverbial intensification with the superlative. With the definite article the, it can only be a superlative, but with the indefinite article a it can only be interpreted adverbially (i.e. essentially the same as ""very beautiful""). Both of these forms, however, allow omission of the article, and so the meaning of #2 is left ambiguous.

Note that there is a third form which is related to the superlative known as the elative. While it is not a separate inflection, it can be shown to exist in constructions such as the following:


  
  It is with the greatest pleasure [...]
  


This sentence is generally understood not to mean with a pleasure greater than any other, but rather something more akin to with extreme pleasure.

176,216,question and answer 347,Offline tiled map web app,"I'm not sure whether to post this here or on Stackoverflow, as it's sort of a crossover. Let me give it a try.

In the proposed HTML5 standard, there's the option of storing web application data in a local cache using a cache manifest. I am looking to use this technique for an offline tiled web map application and did a quick prototype here based on a standard install of Geoserver. 

I just ripped the OpenLayers client page that is generated from one of the default layers and changed the &lt;html&gt; tag to 

&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" manifest=""cache.manifest""&gt;


And created the file cache.manifest which simply reads

CACHE MANIFEST
http://lima.schaaltreinen.nl:8080/


Which should, in my limited understanding of the matter, locally cache everything that loads from that URL: all tiles and the OpenLayers JS. In fact, upon first call in Firefox, it does ask me to allow local storage, but when I hit refresh - either online or offline - the page croaks stating that the OpenLayers object is not defined. Looks like it hasn't loaded the OpenLayers JS.

Anyone successfully did a functioning offline OpenLayers-based tiled web map app? Or hints on how to investigate this further?

But, given a standard super thick, thin paged Bible with no tabs and characteristically ignoring the index page like one would expect an eighth grader might, what mnemonic and memorization devices do people use to find the relative position of certain books in the Bible?

(I'd prefer Catholic answers using Catholic Bibles, but any wisdom is appreciated)
",Peter Turner,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/4,"I learned this technique on Protestant Bibles but you could easily adapt it for any Bible. It works best if you have everyone use their own Bible so that they can see how the technique applies to the Bible they use most.


Psalms is usually at the center of most Bibles. If you're looking for Psalms you try to open to the middle of the book.
The New Testament tends to start around the last quarter of the Bible.
So let's say you're looking for John 3:16.

It's in the New Testament so it's in the last quarter of the Bible.
It's a Gospel so it's at the front of that last quarter.
Flip to about the last quarter of the book. If you land on John great.
If you landed somewhere else is it before or after John?



This also goes hand in hand with memorizing the order of the books which the best I can do is a song that I think I might still have somewhere on VHS but you can just hit up YouTube and find something your kids will like.

Even more helpful is understanding the sections of the Bible.


Law
History
Poetry &amp; Wisdom
Major Prophets
Minor Prophets
Gospels
Pauline Epistles
General Epistles
Prophecy


So from the example above, if the open the Bible to somewhere other than John it goes:


What book are you on?
Is it before or after John?


Is it Old Testament or New? If it's old you move back. New could be either way.
What section is it in? If it's a Gospel, which one? (in this case any one means move back slowly)
If it's not at least one of the minor prophets then you're probably way too far ahead.
Likewise if you landed in Revelation then you're too far back. (This actually happens because of maps and other stuff they cram into Bibles these days.)



It plays out like a game of 20 questions. Every time you move you repeat the steps. I don't remember it taking long for us to pick this up but, the more time they spend using an actual Bible with no search aids, the faster they'll get it.

228,279,question and answer 450,How are integers internally represented at a bit level in Java?,"I am trying to understand how Java stores integer internally. I know all java primitive integers are signed, (except short?). That means one less bit available in a byte for the number.

My question is, are all integers (positive and negative) stored as two's complement or are only negative numbers in two's complement?

I see that the specs says x bit two's complement number. But I often get confused.

For instance:

  int x = 15; // Stored as binary as is?  00000000 00000000 00000000 00001111?
  int y = -22; // Stored as two complemented value? 11111111 11111111 11111111 11101010


Edit

To be clear, x = 15 

   In binary as is: `00000000 00000000 00000000 00001111'
  Two's complement: `11111111 11111111 11111111 11110001`


So if your answer is  all numbers are stored as two's complement then:

  int x = 15; // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11110001
  int y = -22 // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11101010


The confusion here again is the sign says, both are negative numbers. May be I am misreading / misunderstanding it?

Edit
Not sure my question is confusing. Forced to isolate the question:

My question precisely: Are positive numbers stored in binary as is while negative numbers are stored as two's complement?

Some said all are stored in two's complement and one answer says only negative numbers are stored as two's complement.
",Kevin Rave,https://stackoverflow.com/users/668650,"Java integers are of 32 bits, and always signed. This means, the most significant bit (MSB) works as the sign bit. The integer represented by an int is nothing but the weighted sum of the bits. The weights are assigned as follows:

Bit#    Weight
31      -2^31
30       2^30
29       2^29
...      ...
2        2^2
1        2^1
0        2^0


Note that the weight of the MSB is negative (the largest possible negative actually), so when this bit is on, the whole number (the weighted sum) becomes negative.

Let's simulate it with 4-bit numbers:

Binary    Weighted sum            Integer value
0000       0 + 0 + 0 + 0           0
0001       0 + 0 + 0 + 2^0         1
0010       0 + 0 + 2^1 + 0         2
0011       0 + 0 + 2^1 + 2^0       3
0100       0 + 2^2 + 0 + 0         4
0101       0 + 2^2 + 0 + 2^0       5
0110       0 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 0       6
0111       0 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0     7 -&gt; the most positive value
1000      -2^3 + 0 + 0 + 0        -8 -&gt; the most negative value
1001      -2^3 + 0 + 0 + 2^0      -7
1010      -2^3 + 0 + 2^1 + 0      -6
1011      -2^3 + 0 + 2^1 + 2^0    -5
1100      -2^3 + 2^2 + 0 + 0      -4
1101      -2^3 + 2^2 + 0 + 2^0    -3
1110      -2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 0    -2
1111      -2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0  -1


So, the two's complement thing is not an exclusive scheme for representing negative integers, rather we can say that the binary representation of integers are always the same, we just negate the weight of the most significant bit. And that bit determines the sign of the integer.

In C, there is a keyword unsigned (not available in java), which can be used for declaring unsigned int x;. In the unsigned integers, the weight of the MSB is positive (2^31) rather than being negative. In that case the range of an unsigned int is 0 to 2^32 - 1, while an int has range -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.

From another point of view, if you consider the two's complement of x as ~x + 1 (NOT x plus one), here's the explanation:

For any x, ~x is just the bitwise inverse of x, so wherever x has a 1-bit, ~x will have a 0-bit there (and vice versa). So, if you add these up, there will be no carry in the addition and the sum will be just an integer every bit of which is 1.

For 32-bit integers:

x + ~x = 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111
x + ~x + 1 =   1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 + 1
           = 1 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000


The leftmost 1-bit will simply be discarded, because it doesn't fit in 32-bits (integer overflow). So,

x + ~x + 1 = 0
-x = ~x + 1


So you can see that the negative x can be represented by ~x + 1, which we call the two's complement of x.

249,309,question and answer 498,Unique Existence and the Axiom of Choice,"The axiom of choice states that arbitrary products of nonempty sets are nonempty. 
Clearly, we only need the axiom of choice to show the non-emptiness of the product if 
there are infinitely many choice functions. If we use a choice function to construct a mathematical object, the object will often depend on the specific choice function being used. So constructions that require the axiom of choice often do not provide the existence of a unique object with certain properties. In some cases they do, however. The existence of a cardinal number for every set (ordinal that can be mapped bijectively onto the set) is such an example.


  What are natural examples outside of
  set theory where the existence of a
  unique mathematical object with
  certain properties can only be proven
  with the axiom of choice and where the
  uniqueness itself can be proven in ZFC (I
  don't want the uniqueness to depend on
  a specific model of ZFC)? 


The next question is a bit more vague, but I would be interested in some kind of birds-eye view on the issue.


  Are there some general guidelines to understand in which cases the axiom of choice can be  used to construct a provably unique object with certain properties?


This question is motivated by a discussion of uniqueness-properties of certain measure theoretic constructions in mathematical economics that make heavy use of non-standard analysis. 

Edit: Examples so far can be classified in three categories: 

Cardinal Invariants: One uses the axiom of choice to construct a representation by some ordinal. Since ordinals are canonically well ordered, this gives us a unique, definable object with the wanted properties. Example: One takes the dimension (as a cardianl) of a vector space and constructs the vector space as functions on finite subsets of the cardinal (François G. Dorais).

AC Properties: One constructs the object canonically ""by hand"" and then uses the axiom of choice to show that it has a certain property. Trivial example:  $2^\mathbb{R}$ as the family of well-orderable sets of reals.

Employing all choice functions: Here one gets uniqueness by requiring the object to contain in some sense all objects of a certain kind that can be obtained by AC. Examples: The Stone-Čech compactification as the set of all ultrafilters on it (Juris Steprans), or the dual space of a vector space, the space of all linear functionals. (Martin Brandenburg) The AC is used to show that these spaces are rich enough. Formally, these examples might be categorized in the second category, but they seem to have a different flavor.
",Michael Greinecker,https://mathoverflow.net/users/35357,"If you are satisified with your example of the cardinals as unique objects defined using choice then there is an easy answer to your question. Note that there is not a unique ordinal which is in bijective correspondence with each set; there are many, but there is always a least one which we call a cardinal. So the uniqueness comes from the well ordering of the ordinals. Given the axiom of choice you can always well order the domain of objects in which you are interested and then choose the least one. This will of course, be unique, but I doubt this is what you had in mind. But I think it does show that a better example than the cardinals is needed for uniqueness.

One can construct saturated models by transfinite induction and then show that, under certain circumstances, these are unique. One also has $\beta \mathbb{N}\setminus \mathbb{N}$ which needs choice to be non-empty, and it is also unique --- but probably also not what you had in mind.

270,338,question and answer 540,How do I tell the difference between a borrowed chord and a key change?,"Having muddled through for a few years, I'm finally learning the basics of harmony. I'm having a bit of trouble, though understanding exactly what goes on when chords occur from outside the key. Is the key changing? Or are these 'borrowed' chords, and in which case, how are they decided on?

For example, see the classic ""I Can't Forget"" by Leonard Cohen.


            
                
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                
            

Here is an apparently accurate transcription of the chords in the verse:

http://www.maartenmassa.be/CohenChords/09iym/i_cant_forget.htm

    F#
I stumbled out of bed
       D#m
I got ready for the struggle
F#
I smoked a cigarette
     D#m               C#
And I tightened up my gut
   B         Bm       G#m
I said this can't be me
 A#          E    D#m
Must be my double
F#              B    
And I can't forget... (etc)


OK, so I see I-vi-I-vi-V of F# major, taking us to the line ""I said this can't be me"". This makes sense to me. But what happens then? 

It seems to modulate to B minor - fine, I think we're heading for a scale with B minor in it, ie A major, D major(/B minor),  or G major. But this is followed immediately by G#m, though, so it's not any of those (maybe we're back in F#?), but then we get A#!? E? 

I am totally confused at this point as to what key we're in.

It's particularly galling as the change to A# is my favourite chord change in the song, and the whole run from B to D#m, and then back to F#, is weirdly satisfying.

Can anyone explain what's going on here?
",djb,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/10437,"This seems to be just an unusual chord sequence  (ie, one that we're not used to hearing) within some otherwise fairly natural sounding chords.

I's say this isn't a key change. The next verse starts on the same chord (F#) and does the same thing so the context of the chord sequence doens't change.

At least until the end of second verse (I haven't listened further), the song is in the key F#.. major ? Only because that';s how the first line is sung (ish, he'sa bit wobbly lol).

F#major and Dm scales don't share a heck of a lot of notes, and the sequence does this kind of thing elsewhere so it seems he's going for a notion of breaking some rules and having it sound like it all fits together.

307,382,question and answer 602,Adjustment to road bike brakes for high grade downhill,"I have a road bike with a front brake that wears a lot of brake pad when I ride downhill every day. I lose 900ft in elevation on steep grades with lots of stop signs and traffic lights. On top of that, it rains a decent amount and the rim brakes are terrible in that weather. I don't trust them downhill in the rain. Sometimes I just walk.

I feather the brakes going downhill, because otherwise I'm too fast to stop quickly for an errant car.

It'd be nice to not constantly replace pads, and have powerful stopping. How can I make this constant downhill more pleasant?

Thanks. 
",ash,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/14519,"There are several solutions:

(1) Switch your brake pads - a harder compound will wear less, but be less effective at braking. Make sure to clean your rims for rim brakes as well. 

(2) Use your brakes less and get more comfortable with higher speeds.

(3) Change your brakes (some brake models brake better than others, even if you're using the same type of brakes, e.g. caliper brakes).

327,407,question and answer 633,Battery Drains Every 1-3 Weeks,"I have been experiencing a slow draining of the battery for the past 1-2 months wherein the vehicle will be fine and suddenly the vehicle will not start.  

First thought was the battery, as the vehicle has about 90000 on it.  I could have tested it, but didn't; just bought another one thinking it would save the trouble soon enough if it wasn't the battery.  On installing the battery, I checked for the usual: lights left on, doors left open, etc.  But there was nothing out of the ordinary.

Two weeks later, the new battery drained. I charged up the old one swapped it in.  One week later, that one was drained.  

Determined now that it was not the battery, I searched high and low for some good tests.  I did a ground test (all less than 2-1ohm), point to point resistance check(all 1-2ohm), parasitic draw test (30mA after entering sleep mode), and charging voltage test.  Everything looked satisfactory.  The only thing that I noticed was, if I left the nominal voltage charging test run, for minutes, I would slowly watch the voltage creep down.  After twenty minutes I was seeing 13.8V after starting at 14.3V (measured across the battery terminals).  I ran out of time to swap out the battery on my multimeter (thinking this might be the culprit), so it could just be that.  But, I'm curious.  Does a slow fall of the charging voltage (across the battery terminals) indicate an alternator problem?  Belt tensioner problem?  Looking for thoughts on this slow decline in charging voltage across the battery to determine where to dig into next.  I didn't see how low it could go, but if the community thinks it's worth a shot, I'll do it (even if it means an hour to find it).

",N8sBug,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/6216,"I would place this as being an issue with the alternator. Take it in and have it checked, but I bet the reason is one (or more) of the diodes in the alternator is not working, which does not allow for a charge to occur correctly.

329,410,question and answer 636,"""God is Fire"": Trying to Source an Analogy for Prayer","I remember reading once a very clever analogy, which I was sure that I had found in the writings of Yeshayahu Leibowitz (who sourced it, from memory, in the writings of the Rav, R' Yosef Ber Soloveitchik, who himself sourced it in the Rambam), but I can no longer locate it at all. In essence, the analogy stated that God is like fire. Different objects, when dropped into the fire, react differently. Some become hard. Some become soft. Some let off smoke. Some change their hue. Some make a noise. Some might explode. But while all of these different reactions can be found, at no stage is the fire anything other than a fire; the difference in responses to it is to be found in the different objects that come into contact with it.

So too, the analogy concluded, when it comes to our relationship with God. When we pray, we change ourselves in order that God might interact more favourably with us. We do not hope for God to change in any way, but for ourselves to change instead. God's influence upon the world is constant and unchanging; it is we who are in flux.

Does this analogy sound familiar to anybody? If you can direct me to a printed source (be it in the writings of the Rav, or Prof. Leibowitz, or whomever it was who came up with this), I would be much obliged.

  He compares God's mood to a fire. If you put ice in a fire, it melts, then evaporates. If you put clay in a fire, it hardens. If you put wood in a fire it burns... The fire causes many different and contrasting effects without changing the fire's properties. The same ""fire melts certain things and makes others hard, it boils and burns, it bleaches and blackens."" It is the properties of each individual material that elicit a different interactions with fire.

366,455,question and answer 709,What is it called when a music has two concurrent tempos,"I've recently watched a BBC documentary about the history of music and recall an episode where they talk about music that has two distinct tempos (and possibly time signatures) at the same time for different sets of instruments.

Still, I can't remember how this is called and who are the famous composers that composed that way (Stravinsky?).
",Arthur Rizzo,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/16830,"This sort of thing has been explored pretty deeply by, among other people, Conlon Nancarrow. He used player pianos to perform pieces which would most likely have been too complex for anyone to perform organically. One way in which he complicated things was that he used what he called a tempo canon. As discussed here, one such piece was his Study for Player Piano 41a. It used multiple voices, each with its own tempo and the ratios were on a strict, but irrational ratio. If the ratio between tempos was rational, it would line up, or converge, so that two notes could fall at the same time. However, if the ratio was irrational, they would never converge and dance around each other until the piece ended.

This basic concept, although the effect can be jarring, is really not very different from polyrhythms and polymeters. It's just obfuscated by using complicated ratios. For example, if you have a bar and a main voice hit four evenly spaced beats, you have the standard quarter note pulse in 4/4. You can fit 3 notes evenly into that same bar in a second voice and the second voice will be playing half-note triplets. For every four notes in the main voice and every three notes in the second voice, the voices will play together. That's your bar. And that's a polyrhythm. That would be a 4:3 ratio. I'm not sure that's how it's typically notated, but the idea translates. You can imagine how this can be seen as two voices at different tempos. Say maybe one voice in 4/4 at 120 and another voice in 3/4 at 90. They would line up the same way.

Here's another example. If your main voice plays 8 eighth notes before repeating and your second voice plays 7 eighth notes before repeating, they will line up every 56 (7×8) eighth notes. In other words, after your main voice repeats seven times and your second voice repeats eight times. That's a polymeter. Now you can see how these concepts can get mixed up. As the ratios get more complicated (ie 128:73) or less rational (ie √2:φ), the tempos line up less and less and the individual tempos will get closer and/or less distinguishable. That is where you cross the line into tempo canon territory.


  Note: I understand that 'irrational ratio' is a terrible oxymoron, but
  I can't think of better terminology. Also, this is just the one conceptualization of

It seems that the version of libc that I'm compiling against is
different.  I tried also adding libc to the batch of libraries the
same way I did for libgmp but this results in a segmentation fault
when the application starts on the Heroku side.

Everything works fine on my PC.  I'm running 64bit archlinux with ghc
7.0.3.  The blog post on the official Yesod blog looked pretty easy
but I'm stumped at this point.  Anyone have any ideas?  If there's a way to get this thing working without building statically I'm open to that too.

EDIT

Per Employed Russians answer I did the following to fix this.

First created a new directory lib under the project directory and copied the missing shared libraries into it.  You can get this information by running ldd path/to/executable and heroku run ldd path/to/executable and comparing the output.

I then did heroku config:add LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib so when the application is started the dynamic linker will look for libraries in the new lib directory.

Finally I created an ubuntu 11.10 virtual machine and built and deployed to Heroku from there, this has an old enough glibc that it works on the Heroku host.

Edit:
I've since written a tutorial on the Yesod wiki
",asm,https://stackoverflow.com/users/166732,"I have no idea what Yesod is, but I know exactly what each of your other errors means.

First, you should not try to link statically. The warning you get is exactly right: if you link statically, and use one of the routines for which you are getting the warning, then you must arrange to run on a system with exactly the same version of libc.so.6 as the one you used at build time.

Contrary to popular belief, static linking produces less, not more, portable executables on Linux.

Your other (static) link errors are caused by missing libopenssl.a at link time.

But let's assume that you are going to go the ""sane"" route, and use dynamic linking.

For dynamic linking, Linux (and most other UNIXes) support backward compatibility: an old binary continues to work on newer systems. But they don't support forward compatibility (a binary built on a newer system will generally not run on an older one).

But that's what you are trying to do: you built on a system with glibc-2.14 (or newer), and you are running on a system with glibc-2.13 (or older).

The other thing you need to know is that glibc is composed of some 200+ binaries that must all match exactly. Two key binaries are /lib/ld-linux.so and /lib/libc.so.6 (but there are many more: libpthread.so.0, libnsl.so.1, etc. etc). If some of these binaries came from different versions of glibc, you usually get a crash. And that is exactly what you got, when you tried to place your glibc-2.14 libc.so.6 on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH -- it no longer matches the system /lib/ld-linux.

So what are the solutions? There are several possibilities (in increasing difficulty):


You could copy ld-2.14.so (the target of /lib/ld-linux symlink) to the target system, and invoke it explicitly:

/path/to/ld-2.14.so --library-path &lt;whatever&gt; /path/to/your/executable


This generally works, but can confuse an application that looks at argv[0], and breaks for applications that re-exec themselves.
You could build on an older system.
You could use appgcc (this option has disappeared, see this for description of what it used to be).
You could set up a chroot environment matching the target system, and build inside that chroot.
You could build yourself a Linux-to-olderLinux crosscompiler

417,523,question and answer 824,Prove that any real function defined on a real open interval has at most countably many simple discontinuities.,"This is problem 17 in baby Rudin's chapter on continuity. He has a hint to use triplets of rationals that bound each simple discontinuity on the left, right, and in between the values of the limits from the left and right. It seems like this can be weakened to just rationals to the left and right. 

Simple discontinuities are those in which the limit from the left and right exist, so there must be intervals to the left and right of a simple continuity on which no other simple discontinuity can exist. More precisely, let $c$ and $c'$ be simple discontinuities for $f$ on $(a,b)$ and consider the limit, $l$, of $f$ approaching $c$ from the left:

$\forall \epsilon &gt;0, \exists \delta&gt;0 : c-x&lt;\delta \Rightarrow |l-f(x)|&lt;\epsilon$

but $ \exists \epsilon '&gt;0 \forall \delta ' &gt;0 : |c'-x|&lt;\delta ' \Rightarrow |f(c')-f(x)|&gt;\epsilon '
\\ \therefore \epsilon = \epsilon ' , \delta ' = \delta \rightarrow \leftarrow
$

Therefore, you can make an injection from the set of simple discontinuities to a subset of rationals by associating each simple discontinuity with one rational in the aforementioned ""free"" interval to its left; from there compose with the map from rationals to integers to show countable. Is this argument correct?
",user2303321,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/84960,"
  so there must be intervals to the left and right of a simple continuity on which no other simple discontinuity can exist.


That is incorrect. Consider an enumeration $r_n$ of the rationals, and let

$$f(x) = \sum_{\substack{n \in \mathbb{N}\\r_n &lt; x}} 2^{-n}.$$

Then $f$ is a strictly monotonic function that has a jump discontinuity in every rational number.

However, as the points of discontinuity approach any fixed $y \in \mathbb{R}$, the jumps tend to $0$, in fact, the sum of all jumps in the discontinuities $\neq y$ contained in a neighbourhood of $y$ tends to $0$ when the neighbourhood shrinks to a point.

425,533,question and answer 838,Weren't there originally going to be nine Star Wars films?,"I seem to remember reading that there were going to be three trilogies originally in Star Wars, i.e. they would add episodes 7 - 9.

Was that ever the case? What happened to that plan?

Update: looks like that original plan might be back after all!
",Wikis,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/143,"Depending on his plans at the time and when you asked him, George Lucas has variously said there would be one film, three films, six films, nine films or 12 films.

A trilogy of trilogies

It was widely reported in 1980 that there would be nine films: a trilogy of trilogies.

Al Walentis wrote in the May 25, 1980 Reading Eagle:


  Lucas originally envisioned ""Star Wars"" as a single feature, but his 200-page screenplay proved too unwieldy. He then began tinkering with his story line, cutting it apart, sorting our all the various subplots. The script finally was pieced together as three distinct trilogies. 
  
  ""There are essentially nine films,"" Lucas said. ""The first trilogy is about the young Ben Kenobi and the early life of Luke Skywalker's father when Luke was a young boy. The first trilogy takes place some 20 years before the second. About a year elapses between each story of the first trilogy. The whole adventure - encompassing the three trilogies - spans about 40 years.""


Irvin Kershner, director of The Empire Strikes Back (1980), was also on-script with the nine-film plan. Tom Buckley of the N.Y. Times wrote on May 25, 1980's The Spokesman-Review:


  ""I told George I didn't want to do a sequel,"" Kershner said.""He said, 'I don't blame you. Neither would I, but this isn't. It's the second act of the second trilogy of nine films I plan to make in this theme. I want it to be better than mine.' ...""


On the same page of the same paper, Richard Freeman of Newhouse News wrote:


  Three years ago, Hamill signed up for three ""Star Wars"" films, of which ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the second. The third - still in the planning stage - will be called ""The revenge of the Jedi,"" and Hamill worries that these titles will suggest the various Pink Panther sequels to audiences.
  
  If things work out, these three movies will eventually constitute only a third of the projected nine-movie ""Star Wars"" saga, but Hamill doesn't plan to be in any of the others.


On the following page of the same paper, Aljean Harmetz of the New York Times wrote:


  The ""Star Wars"" George Lucas has created in his mind will take nine movies to tell. ""Star Wars"" is actually ""Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope,"" the first movie of the second trilogy. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is ""Star Wars, Episode V,"" while ""The Return of the Jedi' is episode VI. The first trilogy deals with the young Darth Vader and the young Ben Kenobi. At the end of the first trilogy, Luke Skywalker is four years old. Only the robots - R2D2 and C-3PO - will be characters in all the movies.
  
  He chose to start in the middle because the first trilogy is, he says, ""more plot-oriented, more soap-operaish."" He adds that the ""central core problem"" of ""Star Wars"" hasn't even been stated yet. Although he originally saw Star Wars as six movies, his ""dream"" was only for ""Star Wars"" to do well enough so that he could finish the three movies in the second trilogy. ""If people had laughed 'Star Wars' off the screen, I'd have been less surprised than I was at what did happen,"" he says. ""Until the day it opened, I felt it would do $16 million and, if I pushed hard, I could make 'Empire.'""


An interview with Harrison Ford in Lakeland Ledger of July 4, 1980:


  Like Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Ford has already signed up for the third ""Star Wars"" film, which is tentatively entitled ""The Revenge of the Jedi."" This will conclude the middle trilogy of the nine-part series, and Ford does not know whether it signals the end of Han Solo. It is up to George Lucas, the creator of the saga.
  
  ""He has an idea of doing one (involving what happened to Solo) about 15 years from now, when I'll be 53. That's something I'd like to do.""


The Phoenix of June 21, 1980 also mentions the three trilogies spanning 40 years, and:


  Thereafter, Lucas will go back to the first trilogy, starting with a story so far back that it does not include Darth Vader.
  
  If interest sustains, Star Wars could be in production well into the 1990s. David Prowse figures he'll get killed off (by Luke Skywalker?) in the seventh or eighth story.


At least one trilogy

And it seems at least one trilogy was planned from the start. One week after Star Wars came out, The Leader-Post of June 3, 1977 says:


  [Mark] Hamill said he believes Lucas plans a Star Wars trilogy because all the actors are under contract for two more films.


Reporting on the film's record-breaking success, an AP story in May 26, 1978's Schenectady Gazette says:


  Lucas had originally conceived of ""Star Wars"" as a trilogy. Work on the first sequel is well under way...


12 films

An article by Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times, printed in The Tuscaloosa News of June 15, 1979, quotes The Empire Strikes Back producer Gary Kurtz:


  Kurtz says that there are on paper the makings of a grand design of 12 films, including three stories that would historically precede the Skywalker takes (prequels, as they are dreadfully know these days).


A May 5, 1980 article quotes David Prowse as saying ""They plan to do 12 movies.""

13 movies

Finally, this 1979 promo advert for Kenner Star Wars claims:


  ""That's right, Star Wars is forever. George Lucas and 20th Century Fox have plans for twelve more block-busting chapters to the Star Wars story.


So does that make 13?

15 and more

Lucas is selling Lucasfilm and the Star Wars rights to the Walt Disney Company who according to CNN (October 31, 2012) will make at least three sequel films, and then another film every two years (which might might not be sequels), and also possibly a television series:


  ""It's now time for me to pass Star Wars on to a new generation of filmmakers,"" George Lucas said in a written statement. ""I've always believed that Star Wars could live beyond me, and I thought it was important to set up the transition during my lifetime.""
  
  Lucas said he will work as a creative consultant on Star Wars Episode 7, the first of a planned new trilogy of live-action Star Wars movies. It is targeted for release in 2015, Disney said.
  
  Disney hopes to essentially relaunch the Star Wars film franchise, which had its last installment in 2005 with Revenge of the Sith. Following the three planned sequels, the company envisions releasing even more Star Wars movies at a rate of a new film every two to three years.
  
  Future movies may not be sequels but movies that focus on fringe characters. Disney also believes there is potential for a television series.

426,535,question and answer 840,Equivalent Key Signatures,"I've noticed that a variety of pieces in the classical repetoire (certainly at least the piano repetoire), label what seems to be effectively the same key signature differently. That is, I am not aware of any differences in terms of key between a piece in ""G Sharp major"" and ""A flat major"" (or their equivalent minors). Is there any reason that sometimes a sharped key signature is used while at other times the equivalent flatted key signature is used?

As a related point, I have undoubtedly noticed the preference of certain ""equivalent"" key signatures over others. For example, one encounters ""E flat"" significantly more than ""D sharp"" and likewise ""C sharp"" significantly more than ""D flat"". Is there any particular reason for this, or is it simply a convention that has been handed down to use through musical history?
",Noldorin,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/179,"There is a strong case for certain enharmonic key uses
depending on the mode (minor/Major).

These four little tables show that Eb is significantly 
easier to write than D# for a major scale as
the latter would involve double sharps in the signature.

But F# and Gb Major are really close in complexity.

Major scales

Number of #s (upper lines) versus enharmonic number of bs



Number of bs (upper lines) versus enharmonic number of #s



Likewise C# minor is to be prefered to Db minor
but D# and Eb are interchangeable and this is indeed
what Bach did in its Well Tempered Keyboard (Preludium 8 and Fugue 8, BWV 853). He used
one for the prelude and the other for the fugue (See Alex Basson's answer about the validity of this substitution).

Minor scales

430,539,question and answer 848,Congenital blindness due to retinitis pigmentosa - does it exist?,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients typically become blind after a period of years in which their eye sight slowly deteriorates due to photoreceptor degeneration. Generally RP patients develop night-blindness first, then tunnel vision, after which finally the central eye sight diminishes leaving them with basically no eye sight, bar some crude light perception. The wiki page on RP has more information when needed. Typically, the process from diagnosis of RP to (near) complete loss of eye sight takes years to decades.

However, Chebat et al. (2007) make mention that their study group, consisting of congenitally blind subjects, includes one person with RP (see table 1 in the linked article). Hence, this implicates that this particular subject was blind from birth due to effects of RP.

435,545,question and answer 858,How Do I Fix Excess Contribution Withdrawl,"This is a kind of a straight forward situation but I made it little complex due to my limited knowledge of Traditional IRA and 401(k).

In the year 2012, I was working as a contractor. I had a traditional IRA account with Fidelity and contributed $4000 to it for the Tax Year 2012.

Later in that year (2012), I got a full time job and my employer enrolled me in their 401(k) plan.

When the time came to file the taxes, I called Fidelity and explained them the situation as I thought I cannot contribute to Traditional IRA as I have employer sponsored 401(k). Someone at the Fidelity said I can withdraw the money as ""Excess Contribution Withdrawal"". So I filled out the form and pulled $4000 from it. I did not claim the $4000 contribution in my tax return as ""Traditional IRA Contribution"". I just treated it as like I never contributed that money.

Now I got 1099-R from them saying the $4000 that I withdraw was actually processed as ""Early Withdrawal"" and I have to pay tax (33%) on it.

When I explained them what happened in 2012, they said they may be able to go back and correct the problem.

What I do not understand is that even if they correct the situation and send me revised 1099-R, I will still pay Tax on $4000 as it will be treated as ""Excess Contribution"".

Why can this not be simple as I made a mistake when I contributed the money and then I took it back and did not claim so that should be treated as like it never went to my IRA account.

What can I do to avoid paying ""Excess Withdrawal"" tax as I already paid the tax on this $4000 as I never claimed them on my 2012 return.

Am I missing something here or am I not able to explain them the situation correctly?
",Asdfg,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/5105,"I think there are several issues here.

First, there's the contribution. As littleadv said, there is no excess contribution. Excess contribution is only if you exceed the contribution limit. The contribution limit for Traditional IRAs does not depend on how high your income goes or whether you have a 401(k). It's the deduction limit that may depend on those things. Not deducting it is perfectly legitimate, and is completely different than an ""excess contribution"", which has a penalty.

Second, the withdrawal. You are allowed to withdraw contributions made during a year, plus any earnings from those contributions, before the tax filing deadline for the taxes of that year (which is April 15 of the following year, or even up to October 15 of the following year), and it will be treated as if the contribution never happened. No penalties. The earnings will be taxed as regular income (as if you put it in a bank account). That sounds like what you did.

Third, even if (and it does not sound like the case, but if) it doesn't qualify as a return of contributions before the tax due date as described above (maybe you withdrew it after October 15 of the following year), as littleadv mentioned, your contribution was a non-deductible contribution, and when withdrawing it, only the earnings portion (which after such a short time should only be a very small part of the distribution) would be subject to tax and penalty.

My opinion is that better frame quality only is possible with better techniques or when other settings are used. I think it can’t be because of only a frame increasement. It’s true that more frames per second makes new techniques available.

But why do they think that the screen quality is better? Is it maybe because of a higher resolution? Or do they just use other settings?
",Laurence,https://movies.stackexchange.com/users/3733,"There is a huge difference in the feeling of the film based upon the Frames Per Second it was shot in.

There are a number of films that were shot using a digital camera, but at a higher 30FPS that were reviewed to have a ""poor quality or feel"" because the faster shutter rate gave it a television feeling.

Many professional digital camera now shoot at the slower 24FPS to capture that film feeling.

Many faster 30FPS digital cameras often produced a cleaner, sharper, wider range of color image that was perceived to be to different from traditional film stock. That the color space and feel of film could not be reproduced digitally. Much of this is true.

Today, many digital cameras now use all the same lens, hardware and mounts that older traditional film cameras used. The sensors are much more refined and adjusted to give a more natural color space. Post-processing has also greatly improved to reproduce many film stocks as a digital filter.

If you were speaking to someone who was not technical, but experienced in the film industry. He may have experienced producing films at 30FPS which were much sharper and cleaner then traditional 24FPS film stock. As a result. I can totally understand his perspective that 30FPS has a higher quality image.

The techniques to produce 30FPS and 24FPS films at one time was very different. Today, it's better to clarify that the difference is not frame rate, but film versus digital.

Additionally, frames per second can have a direct impact on the type of motion blur produced in an image. The higher the frame rate the less motion blur there is. Resulting in a cleaner sharper image for objects in motion.

468,583,question and answer 910,Calculating pH of diprotic and amphoteric solutions,"I am trying to understand this problem and its corresponding solution (complete solution not shown)





First off, from the above one can see that the equilibrium constants when $\ce{H2ASO4-}$ donates and receives a proton are as follows:
\begin{aligned}
\ce{H2AsO4 &amp;&lt;=&gt; HAsO4^{2-} + H+} &amp; K_2 &amp;= 1.1 \cdot 10^{−7}\\
\ce{H2AsO4- + H+ &amp;&lt;=&gt; H3AsO4}    &amp; K_{-1} &amp;= 1.6 \cdot 10^{2}\\
\end{aligned}

However, if this is an amphoteric substance as the solution claims, shouldn't both $K_a$ values be comparable? It seems logical that if it is able to act as both an acid and a base, the equilibrium constants should at least be similar to each other. Instead, one is several order of magnitudes larger than the other? Why can this be true and $\ce{H2ASO4-}$ still be an amphoteric substance?



Next, how did they arrive at the statement


  We approximately have the equality relation: $$\ce{[H3AsO4]} = \ce{[HAsO4^{2−}]}$$


What is the evidence that shows this to be true? Isn't the $K_a$ value of the basic reaction ($1.6 \times 10^2$) much larger than that of the acidic reaction? Why should the concentrations be equal?



Finally, let's say you are calculating the pH for the diprotic substance $\ce{H2S}$, which undergoes the following diassociations:

$$\ce{H2S &lt;=&gt; H+ + HS-}$$
$$\ce{HS- &lt;=&gt; H+ + S^{2-}}$$

To find the pH you would assume that the first reaction is dominant, and that the effects of the second reaction consuming $\ce{HS-}$ are minimal, and then calculate the pH from there — right? 

However, why can't you treat $\ce{HS-}$ as an amphoteric substance (because it can both gain and lose a proton) and then calculate the pH as you would for an amphoteric substance (as seen in the image at the beginning)?
",1110101001,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/2142,"I'll address your questions in 3 parts: 

(A) Why amphoteric

(B) How to solve the problem without making unexplained assumptions

(C) Why the solution in the book uses the approximate equality
    $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$.

PART (A)

An amphoteric species (molecule or ion) is one that can either gain a proton with relative ease, or lose a proton with relative ease. ""Relative ease"" means, for example, that it can happen in aqueous solution. If your species will gain a proton in the presence of enough $\ce{H3O+}$, and if it will lose a proton in the present of enough $\ce{OH-}$, it can certainly be called amphoteric.

Translated into equilibrium constants, if your species has a pKa between 0 and 14, and its conjugate acid (what you get when you protonate it) also has a (necessarily lower) $pK_a$ between 0 and 14, your species will act in aqueous solution as either as an acid (losing a proton in the presence of strong base) or as a base (gaining a proton in the presence of strong acid).

The $pK_a$ of (neutral) arsenic acid is between 2 and 3 (because the equilibrium constant for removing the first proton, $K_1$, is between $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-3}$). The $pK_a$ of the version that lost one proton, $\ce{H2AsO4-}$, is around 7 (from the value of $K_2$). So clearly $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ will gain a proton if the pH is below 1, say, and it will lose a proton if the pH is above 10. This justifies why it's amphoteric.

PART (B)

In a monoprotic acid like HF, all the F appears either as F$^-$ or as HF (two species). You can write down 1 equilibrium equation, a mass balance for F and a charge balance, and solve all three equations simultaneously; when you combine the three you get a quadratic equation that can be solved exactly.

But with a multiprotic acid, things get complicated fast. In this problem you have three equilibrium equations, plus the mass-balance and charge-balance equations.  That's 5 equations in 5 variables.

Fortunately it's possible to combine 4 of them easily, using only high-school algebra. They are the 3 equilibrium equations and the charge balance. This reduces the problem to two variables (the pH and the concentration of one of the arsenic ions) in two equations.

Let's write and combine the 4 equations. There are four arsenic species with varying charges; I'll call their concentrations $A_0,A_1,A_2,A_3$ -- the index denotes the charge (which is 3 minus the number of hydrogens). So $A_0=[\ce{H3AsO4}]$, $A_1=[\ce{H2AsO4-}]$, and so on.

By definition, $A_1[\ce{H^+}]/A_0=K_1$, or equivalently $A_0=A_1[\ce{H^+}]/K_1$. This relates two concentrations, $A_0$ and $A_1$. Similarly $A_1=A_2[\ce{H^+}]/K_2$ and $A_2=A_3[\ce{H^+}]/K_3$.

The important thing is that all these four concentrations are proportional and given one you can find all others if you know the pH. (We don't know the pH, but I'll address that in a moment.)

The charge balance (expressed in moles present in 1 L of solution) is simply 
\begin{equation} 0\,A_0+ 1\,A_1+ 2\,A_2+ 3\,A_3+K_w/[\ce{H^+}]= [\ce{H^+}]+0.1. 
\end{equation}
On the left we have the negative charges, on the right the positive ones. Notes:


The concentration of each arsenic species is multiplied by its charge, obviously.
On the left side, $K_w=10^{-14}$ is the dissociation product of water, and $K_w/[\ce{H^+}]$ represents the concentration of OH$^-$; it will turn out to be negligible, but we don't know that a priori, and including it doesn't make the problem any harder.
The 0.1 on the right comes from Na$^+$ ions; being an alkali metal, sodium does not exist in water solution except in ionic form, so we know [Na$^+$] exactly. This explains something that will be important later: The 0.10 M solution of $\ce{NaH2AsO4}$ is exactly what you obtain by dissolving 0.10 moles of NaOH in one beaker, 0.10 moles of $\ce{H3AsO4}$ in another, and mixing the two, assuming the combined volume is 1 L.


Now we express the left side of (1) in terms of just two
concentrations, $A_3$ and $\ce{[H^+]}$: $$
\begin{aligned}A_1+2\,A_2+3\,A_3&amp;=(\ce{[H^+]}/K_1)\,A_2+2\,A_2+3\,A_3\\
&amp;=(\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)\,A_2+3\,A_3\\
&amp;=(\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)\,A_3+3\,A_3\\
&amp;= \bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr)\,A_3
. \end{aligned} $$

The last line is the key; it allows us to relate the concentration of one arsenic
species to the pH.  With this (and moving the $K_w/\ce{[H+]}$ to the
right)
the charge balance becomes
$$ \bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr)\,A_3
=\ce{[H^+]}+0.1 -K_w/\ce{[H+]}$$
or again
$$ A_3=
=\frac{\ce{[H^+]}+0.1 -K_w/\ce{[H+]}}{\bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr).}$$

This look complicated, but it's easy to put into a spreadsheet. The last step is this: The right [H$^+$] is the one that, with $A_3$ calculated as above, obeys the mass balance, $$ A_3 + A_2 + A_1 + A_0 =0.1.$$

At this point we could declare the multiple-choice problem solved, by cheating a bit: take the various proposed values of  [H$^+$] and see which one works.  For answer (a) the value of the sum $ A_3 + A_2 + A_1 + A_0$ is 0.62; for (b) it is  0.128; for (c) it is 0.10165, and for (d) it is 0.100002.  So the best answer is (d).

What if you didn't have multiple choice? Then you'd want to draw a graph or a table, taking (say) every integer value of pH and connecting them.  Here is such a graph: 



The horizontal axis is pH and the vertical one is total arsenic concentration.  The correct pH is where the vertical coordinate is exactly 0.1, and you can get a good idea of its value by eyeballing, or solve by successive approximations.

Note that this method allows you to solve with no more effort the following problem: what is the pH when you add 0.1 mol/L of $\ce{NaH2AsO4}$ (as in the original problem), plus 0.05 mol/L of $\ce{H3AsO4}$?  The only difference is that now you'll be looking for the point on the graph where the vertical coordinate is 0.1+0.05 = 0.15, instead of 0.1.

PART (C)

Why does the book say that $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$, approximately? And is this a good approximation?

The equality comes from the claim that the ""dominant reactivity"" of $\ce{[H2AsO4-]}$ is $$\ce{2\,H2AsO4- \leftrightharpoons H3AsO4{}+HAsO4^{2-}}.$$ If $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ exchanges protons only with itself, and not with, say, water, then every proton lost by one $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ ion means a proton gained by another $\ce{H2AsO4-}$, and the result is that $\ce{[H3AsO4]}$ and $\ce{[HAsO4^{2-}]}$ are generated in equal amounts.

So given the claim about ""dominant reactivity"", the equality is true, and by the way, the equality implies that the pH is the average of $pK_1$ and $pK_2$. (This follows, by taking logs, from the analysis that I'm guessing your book gives right after the part of the solution you quoted.)

The problem with the claim is that it does not follow from the amphoteric nature of $\ce{H2AsO4^-}$ alone. It requires two additional conditions: You're starting from only $\ce{H2AsO4-}$, and in relatively high concentrations. I'll illustrate why these conditions are necessary:

(1) You have to start with only $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ (plus a counterion that doesn't participate further, like Na$^+$). If you started with some $\ce{H3AsO4}$ in addition, you wouldn't have the equality $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$, even approximately. Or, to use the example you gave, if you start with H$_2$S the amphoteric character of HS$^-$ wont help you calculate the pH of the resulting mix. On the other hand if you started by dissolving NaHS alone, it would.

(2) You have to start with a strong solution. If the original question had specified a 0.1 mM solution instead of a 0.1 M solution, the resulting H$^+$ concentration would not be $2.5\times 10^{-5}$ anymore but $3.3\times 10^{-6}$, and the equality $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$ would be off by a factor of 60!

I hope this helps answer your very interesting and perceptive questions.  Don't hesitate to ask for further clarification if necessary!

This one is rough. You can't punish someone due to plagiarism before they submit work. The best policy, in my opinion, is twofold. 

First - if a student brings plagiarized work then you should simply say ""I'm sorry, I cannot help you with work that is not your own."" and point to you university's policy regarding academic dishonesty. Repeat offenders should be put on notice.

Second - If you grade the final assignments or are involved consider spending a bit more time plagiarize-checking these particular student's submissions. These students have shown that they were willing to claim other's work as their own, being a bit more stringent in checking their work for originality is, in my opinion, completely fair.


Students will bring in papers again and again, with little changes

This sounds like a communication problem. After meeting with a student there should be no confusion about what will improve the student's work.

506,630,question and answer 994,Is the number 1 a unit?,"In dimensionless analysis, coefficients of quantities which have the same unit for numerator and denominator are said to be dimensionless. I feel the word dimensionless is actually wrong and should be replaced by ""of dimension number"". For example, the Mach number is of dimension one. 

Many people write, for this case: 


  Mach-Number | Dimension: ""-"" | Unit: ""1""


As mentioned before, I would say 'Dimension: ""1""' in this place. But what about the unit? $\text m/\text s$ divided by $\text m/\text s$ is equal to one. But is the number one a unit by definition? Or should one say that the Mach number has no unit and therefore 'Unit: ""-""'?

My height is measured in metres, but half my height is in $\mathrm{m}1^{-1}$. If you multiply this by two you get back my height in metres, but if you add it to itself you get a quantity that's numerically equal to my height, but has units $\mathrm{m}1^{-1}$.

I think it would be rather difficult to make this consistent, so we have to conclude that if $1$ is a unit, it behaves rather differently from other units. And if that's so, why should we call it a unit at all?

To clarify: I do actually think it's fine to say the units of a quantity are $1$. This answer is only referring to the part of the question that says ""is the number $1$ a unit by definition"", which I took to mean ""is it a base unit, like $\mathrm{m}$ or $\mathrm{K}$?""

523,652,question and answer 1035,How much of the universe is observable at visible wavelengths?,"Knowing that:


The Zone of Avoidance (Looking towards the center of the Milky Way) blocks roughly 20%
Each Milky Way star has an angular size, depending on proximity, that obscures a certain percentage of our optical view.
Each Galaxy has an angular size, depending on proximity, that obscures a certain percentage of our optical view.


And so on through Galaxy Clusters, Superstructures, etc...

What percentage of our universe can we not see at visible wavelengths?
",PJL71,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/16638,"Surprisingly, it makes no sense to make calculations with the angle subtended by objects. They don't simply ""block out"" the light of foreground objects. The Universe is more subtle than that and, when you spot a galaxy, in most cases you can be pretty sure that there isn't anything behind it, at least anything that you would be able to see if the galaxy were removed.

Moreover, the fact that two objects lie along the same line of sight is a happy coincidence, that helps seeing the most distant one, due to gravitational lensing amplification. Usually the background object would be too faint to be detected otherwise. Whole Ph.D. thesis are written every year due to this extraordinary coincidences. See this beautiful image, called the Horseshoe lens, where the image of a distant blue galaxy, that lies far behind a red foreground elliptical, not only is not blocked out, but is even amplified:



(image from Wikipedia Commons http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_Horseshoe_Einstein_Ring_from_Hubble.JPG)

This effect happens too with individual stars, and nowadays telescopes are not able yet to resolve the images in that case, but we can still detect an increase in brightness (that is how a lot of extrasolar planents are being detected). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microlensing .In addition to that, typical transverse speeds of stars make unrealistic that a star can hide another fainter one for much time...

Another fact is that, for nearly all practical purposes, galaxies are transparent. In the worst scenario you can think of, at least the different redshifts in the lines would allow to distinguish between two overimposed images. A famous example is the galaxy ngc7603. Two foreground objects with redshifts ~0.2 and ~0.4 are seen through the galaxy itself at redshift ~0.03:


 (Image from http://quasars.org/ngc7603.htm)

Another famous example is Q2237+030 (known as ""Huchra Lens"" or ""Einstein Cross""), a background quasar that is seen through the very center of a galaxy. As an additional effect, we see four images of the background quasar, thanks to the bulk mass of the foreground galaxy acting as a lens:



(downloaded from http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/agn/qso2237.html)

And, finally the image of a star is not a tiny circle, but a diffuse spot, in the ideal case with faint rings (the so called Airy diffraction pattern, impossible to avoid even for the HST) but usually blurred by the atmosphere and spatially extended thorough the CCD plane. That is why it is so difficult to spot Pluto's moon. Not because the angle the objects subtend, but rather due to technical optical limitations (and atmospheric blurring). In some cases, sophisticated deconvolution algorithms have allowed to see additional objects that were embedded in the blurry image of the star. That is how three planets could be seen around HR8977, a star 140 light-years away:

 

(image from http://keckobservatory.org/gallery/detail/milky_way/27)  

The zone of avoidance is only an annoyance if you want to have data from a particular object in a particular wavelength interval, but it is not important for our understanding of the Universe, since at large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic. Consider too that, if we don't restrict to the tiny portion of the spectrum called visible light, the zone of avoidance is not as bad as it seems. I am still amazed by this infrared movie of stars orbiting the central black hole in our galaxy, that was made looking directly through the avoidance zone:

http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~ghezgroup/gc/pictures/orbitsMovie.shtml

A big progress is being made too in gamma and x-rays detectors. It is not completely unrealistic to think that, in the future, there might be neutrino telescopes that achieve the same resolution of today optical instruments (radio astronomy with optical resolution was too a fantasy at the beginning). That would unveil new regions, for instance it would allow us to look directly at the center of the Sun...

I thought if I cut the coax shorter, I would remove a little cable loss.

I measured SWR with a meter before and after: Before was 1.3:1, after 1.7:1. This seems quite a bit worse. I don't know how much this will affect performance.

Could my antenna setup be sensitive to the length of the coax? I have not heard of tuned lengths but my understanding of antenna and feeds is limited.

Now you have cut of some piece of cable, normaly now it should perform better as the loss is smaller, but the whole impedance has now changed as the xmitter see.

Similarly, the opening of the lips leads to closing off the back of the throat to provide nuances between vowels, which can make ""uh"" sound like ""ugh"", ""oo"" sound like ""eu"", etc. Vocal coaches tear their hair out over this natural accent, especially in the deep South and Texas, where the ""twang"" pollutes the ""pure"" Latin vowels normally desired for singing in almost any language.

However, I doubt you will find an English dialect where a particular vowel shape is never heard. First of all, there will always be a word in the language that even a heavily-accented speaker will pronounce using the shape you're looking for. It may be misplaced, but it'll be there. 

Second, there are degrees of vowel modification from what we would consider ""neutral"" American English to ""accented"", no matter the accent, so you will always find a person who speaks with just the right level of accent to use the vowel shape you're looking for at least some of the time. Urban residents tend to accent less than suburban and rural in my experience, and higher education, which normally involves a mingling of people from many locations nationwide, also tends to reduce accenting. Watching national broadcast TV also tends to reduce accenting, as most actors have their natural accents trained, coached, and/or beaten out of them while on camera.

ParametricPlot[Tootip[{ Cos[u]^v , u}, {v, 0, 1}], {u, 0, Pi/2 }]


How to introduce Tooltip pointers?

( ParametricPlot3D Tooltip may not be available yet? ).

EDIT1:

Updating my question. Please ignore everything above the EDIT1: 

ParametricPlot[ { u Cos[v], u Sin[v]}, {u, 1, 2}, {v, 0, Pi/2}, 
 Mesh -&gt; {3, 5}]


It is a two parameter plot. So I like to see either of $ u,v $ parameter lines being pointed at with the value of the set constant only.

To make clear with an example, when I mouse over circles, like to see Tooltips in the above ParametricPlot pointing with SINGLE values {$ 1,1.25,1.5,1.75,2 $} and also when mousing over radial lines  SINGLE {$ 0, \pi/12, 2 \pi/12,...5 \pi/12, \pi/2 $ }  for the radial lines.

It is a very simple requirement that I believe could cater to a common requirement of a majority of users. I am not looking at high frequency sophisticated dynamic motion picture display. Not even looking at double parameter display at intersection/junction  of parameter lines. Just like the way height is displayed for ContourPlots. Here it is required for both parameters, with or without Shading. 

Asked this because it is not (yet) a standard feature.

EDIT2:

Based on Michael E2's lines, tried to depict eccentric circles.In the space  between parameter lines it may need to be somewhat changed.

{umin, umax, ustep, vmin, vmax, vstep} = {0, 2 Pi, Pi/8, 0.25, 1.25, .25};
ParametricPlot[{Sqrt[2 + v^2] + v Cos[u], v Sin[u]}, {u, umin,  umax}, {v, vmin, vmax}, Mesh -&gt; {Table[{u, Tooltip[Null, u]}, {u, umin, umax, ustep}], 
    Table[{v, Tooltip[Null, v]}, {v, vmin, vmax, vstep}]}] /. {g___, 
   Tooltip[_, label_], l_Line} :&gt; {g, Tooltip[l, label]}

However, I'm wondering if there is a way to compile a release version of the exe with the dlls needed in a folder alongside it.  (I'd prefer not to hunt them each down and copy/paste them in.)
I feel like I'm missing something, or going about it the wrong way.

Is there anyway to have Code::Blocks do this or a better way of obtaining an easy-to-distribute zipfile/project?

",Numeri,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2577654,"CodeBlocks offers the ability to execute pre or post build things. Checkout menu ""Project->Build options"", and under the ""Pre/Post build steps"" tab, you can insert any shell command you want. For example:



When hitting F9, you will see:

Target is up to date.
Running target post-build steps
echo ""Hi""
Hi
Process terminated with status 0 (0 minutes, 0 seconds)
0 errors, 0 warnings (0 minutes, 0 seconds)


So you can add here any command you want to gather you files together, for example something like (using 7-zip):

7z a my_archive.zip myfile1.exe myfile2.dll readme.txt


Be advised that this will be executed at every build which is not something you might want: when compiling a minor change in program, you don't want to wait for the archive program. So maybe do this only in a special build target.

I would make another array out of the current file names, and call it @oldnames.  I'd then do some kind of for loop where each element $i in @oldnames is replaced by the corresponding $i in @newnames.

I don't know how to make an array out of my current file names, though, and so I'm not sure if this vague idea is on the right track.  I keep my files with the messed-up names in a directory called 'oldnames'. The below is my attempt to make an array out of the file names in that directory:

use strict; use warnings;

my $dir = 'oldnames';
opendir ('oldnames', $dir) or die ""cannot open dir $dir: $!"";

",user2585169,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2585169,"Can you do this with rename? It does allow you to use perl code and expressions as arguments if I recall.

The real answer is the one by @chrsblck it does some checks and doesn't make a mess. 

For comparison here is a messy one liner that may suffice.  It relies on you providing a list of equivalent new file names that will rename your list of old files in the correct order.  Perhaps for your situation (where you don't want to do any programmatic transformation of the files names) you could just use a shell loop (see the end of this post) reading lists of new and old names from a file. A better perl solution would be to put both of these file name lists into two columns and then that file using the -a switch , @F and  then useFile::Copy to copy the files around. 

Anyway, below are some suggestions. 

First, set things up: 

 % vim newfilenames.txt # list new names one per line corresponding to old names.
 % wc -l newfilenames.txt # the same number of new names as files in ./oldfiles/
  8 newfilenames.txt
 % ls -1 oldfiles  # 8 files rename these in order to list from newfilenames.txt

With files arranged as above, copy everything over:

perl -MFile::Copy -E 'opendir($dh , oldfiles); @newfiles=`cat newfilenames.txt`; chomp @newfiles; @oldfiles = sort grep(/^.+\..+$/, readdir $dh); END {for $i (0..$#oldfiles){copy(""oldfiles/$oldfiles[$i]"", ""newfiles/$newfiles[$i]""); }}'


Not pretty: you have to grep andsort on @oldfiles to get rid of . .. and put the array elments in order. And there's always the risk that a typo could make a mess and it would be hard to figure out.
If you put the old and new names in a couple of files you could just do this with this with a shell script:

for i in `cat ../oldfilenames.txt` ; do ; done; for n in `cat ../newfilenames.txt`; do cp $i $n;


or just cd into  the directory with the old files and do:

mkdir new
for i in * ; do ; done; for n in `cat ../newfilenames.txt`; do cp $i new/$n;

You could bore holes on the edge of the top or bottom piece to about half the width of the board, then use screws to fasten the two boards together.



You'll likely want to use a drill press to bore the holes.

Glue

Since it's not going to be structural, you could simply glue the two boards together using wood glue.



Sliding Dovetail

If you want to get real fancy, a sliding dovetail would work.



Though with this joint, you'll loose a bit of overall height.

In old version (Raspberry 1) that was a path which make berry to work with Xenomai.
I was started reading about second version about possibility to port old application written for Raspberry 1 with Xenomai to v.2.
",five555,https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/27448,"Looks to me like Xenomai is meant to be source built.  So you should be able to do this.

Someone evidently has precompiled binaries for the regular pi.  The only issue with this will be the kernel: the old armv6 userland will work on the pi 2, but you still need a different kernel for it.

But while armv6 code will run on the pi 2, as noted here (see ""How much faster is it?""), if you want to realize the full potential of the new cores, you need stuff that was compiled for armv7 (which will not run on the old pi).

You probably want to cross-compile, since the pi 2 is still really slow compared to a normal desktop.  Fortunately, ready made x86 -> armv7 tool chains are much easier to find than armv6 ones.

If the instructions on the Xenomai site aren't enough, here's a decent looking guide to building a Xenomai system with a raspbian userspace.  Note again though that this means using slower armv6 user land binaries (there is no armv7 raspbian currently, just the armv6 one with an armv7 kernel) -- however it might provide a simple starting point for you to get a kernel running, and then you can tackle building the userland properly as a second stage.

",Tshepang,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/688,"For convenience, the optimal method is a combination of the answers of jmtd and Faheem.

Using ssh-agent alone means that a new instance of ssh-agent needs to be created for every new terminal you open. keychain when initialized will ask for the passphrase for the private key(s) and store it. That way your private key is password protected but you won't have to enter your password over and over again.

The Arch wiki recommends initializing keychain from /etc/profile.d/ or your shell profile, such as .bash_profile or .bashrc. This has a disadvantage in that it intializes your keychain as soon as you open a terminal.

A more flexible approach is to combine keychain with a specific tmux session. So, in .bash_profile:

tsess=$(tmux ls 2>&1)

if [[ ""${tsess%%:*}"" = ""secured"" ]] && 
   [[ -f $HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh ]]; then
    # start keychain
    /usr/bin/keychain -Q -q --nogui ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    . $HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh
fi

...and then it is just a case of starting the secured tmux session as and when required (launched from a keybind):

#!/bin/bash
PID=$(pgrep tmux)
new=""tmux -f $HOME/.tmux/conf new -s secured""
old=""tmux attach -t secured -d""

if [[ -z ""$SSH_AUTH_SOCK"" ]]; then
    eval `ssh-agent`
    trap ""kill $SSH_AGENT_PID"" 0
fi

if [[ -z ""$PID"" ]]; then
    urxvtc -title ""SSH"" -e sh -c ""${new}""
else
    urxvtc -title ""SSH"" -e sh -c ""${old}""
fi

ssh-add

Now, your keychain will only be initialized once when you start that specific tmux session. As long as that session persists, you will be able to access those ssh keys and push to your remote repositories.

",Anthony Powell,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/27718,"Unlikely. If your house is too cold in the winter, ans especially if it's very windy, you need to start by sealing off places where cold air is coming in. That will often help a ton. The next time it's very windy, just go around the house feeling for drafts and air currents. 

After doing that, you can then start to improve your house's insulation. The attic floor is often low-hanging fruit since you can blow a bunch of cellulose onto the floor very inexpensively. If you have hollow walls, those can be blown full of cellulose as well (in the wall, it needs to be dense-packed) through holes cut in the top of the wall. Basement walls can also be a big win, but to do that properly, you need to add rigid foam insulation boards and make it airtight so moist air can't blow through the insulation boards touch the wall. After that, new windows or low-e storm windows can help.

662,834,question and answer 1328,The number of row value expressions in the INSERT statement exceeds the maximum allowed number of 1000 row values,"One of INSERT INTO script is written as following.

INSERT INTO tableName (Column1, Column2,....) VALUES (value1, Value2,...), (value1, Value2,...),....


Following is the error we are facing on parsing above insert statement


  Msg 10738, Level 15, State 1, Line 1007
  The number of row value expressions in the INSERT statement exceeds the maximum allowed number of 1000 row values.


My simple question is that, Can we change 1000 values limit ?
",aasim.abdullah,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/10181,"No. This hard-coded restriction exists for good reasons related to possible excessive query plan compilation time. You can workaround it by listing the VALUES clauses in a CTE, then INSERTing from the CTE, but I do not recommend it.

Break the INSERT statement up into VALUES clauses of &lt;= 1,000 lines each as a workaround, or use an alternative data loading method such as bcp or BULK INSERT. The fundamental issue may be addressed in a future version of SQL Server. See also Martin Smith's great answer on Stack Overflow.

Not-recommended workaround:

DECLARE @T AS table (c1 int);

-- Error 10738

663,835,question and answer 1330,Converting expressions into functions,"I have defined an expression, such as

a = x


I would like to convert this into a function, such as

f[x_]:=x


However, in my case, the expression on the right-hand-side of a is rather complicated, so I do not want to manually write the expression on the right-hand-side of the function definition. I would like to write something like

f[x_]:=a


I know that this will not work. Is there a way to evaluate a in the function definition to ensure that I have actually defined a function in the end?
",Carl Morris,https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/2037,"In places where a function holds its arguments you can force evaluation by wrapping Evaluate. So for instance Hold[Evaluate[1+2]] will give you 3. The reson the right hand side is not evaluated is because SetDelayed has HoldAll:

 Attributes[SetDelayed]



{HoldAll, Protected, SequenceHold}



but you can simply force evaluation in the same manor:

 a = x^2
 f[x_] := Evaluate[a]

 f[k]



k^2



Depending on how much of your expression you want to evaluate this may work, but there may be cases where you need more control over the evaluation leaving some terms unevaluated until the actual function application of f. If this is the case and this doesn't work for you please extend your question.

As added by Szabolcs. Using Set rather then SetDelayed will also clear this up, since it doesn't hold its right hand side, only the left hand side (the first argument) arguments:

 Attributes[Set]



{HoldFirst, Protected, SequenceHold}



And here is a nice documentation reference again provided by Szabolcs: http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/ImmediateAndDelayedDefinitions.html

666,839,question and answer 1335,Parse order and/or single/double quote issue with Calendar events and Google Map Info Window,"I am utilizing a combination of Solspace 'Calendar', 'Playa', and 'Google Maps for ExpressionEngine'. I'm having a strange issue where the dates aren't showing up correctly in my infowindows on the Google Map, but they show up fine using the same code outside of the infowindow.

So, I have a 'Location' channel, and an 'Event' channel. The Event channel is associated with the Calendar module, and uses a Playa single relationship field to relate it to a Location.

I am adding markers to the map for every 'Location', and for each marker, I'm populating the infowindow with the Location details. this includes using the Playa:Parents method to show all of the events that are at that location. 

I copied the code from the Solspace Calendar demo template for a single event to show the event date, because it had all the conditionals all worked out to deal with single day or multi-day events well. 

My problem is that in the infowindow, it's only showing the 'From' date, and not the 'To' part of the date string. It shows it correctly when I output it outside of the map, though. Here is the code that is outputting the date information. 

    {exp:calendar:events}
    &lt;b&gt;From:&lt;/b&gt; {event_first_date format=""%F %j, %Y at %g:%i%a""}
    {if event_never_ends}
        (never ends)
    {if:else}
        {if ""{event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}"" != ""{event_last_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}""} &lt;b&gt;to:&lt;/b&gt;
            {if ""{event_first_date format=""%Y%m%d""}"" != ""{event_last_date format=""%Y%m%d""}""}
                {event_last_date format=""%l, %F %j, %Y at %g:%i%a""}
            {if:else}
                {event_last_date format=""%g:%i%a""}
            {/if}
        {/if}
    {/if}
    &lt;a href=""{path=find-music/event/{url_title}}""&gt;{title}&lt;/a&gt;
{/exp:calendar:events}


But this is how it outputs, in the infowindow, and outside of the map.

(crap, I don't have enough 'reputation' to post the image here, but it's here: http://paleosun.com/misc/stackexchange-map-calendar-question.jpg)

Notice, the section below the map has the ""to"" date. Same code is used to output it.

I have determined that something is going wrong with the quotes in the event date formatting tags. The {if ""{event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}"" != ""{event_last_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}""} part is never resolving to 'true' like it should. In fact, If I just try to output {event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'} in the infowindow part, nothing show up. However, if I use double quotes and output {event_first_date format=""%Y%m%d%g%i%a""} it DOES work. The problem is, I cannot use that fix in the conditional, because double quotes are already being used around the output of that tag...

Any ideas why? Or what I can do as a work-around?

682,862,question and answer 1370,Wireless link frequency choice (900Mhz vs 5.8Ghz) for 2-3km distance,"I have recently been contracted by a client of mine to facilitate the wireless communication of his ""home"" offices and a secondary site. 

The primary site is the top two floors of a 5-story office building (15m height more or less) an the secondary is one of two open ""lots"" (which one is TBD by management). The ground distance from the secondary sites is a little more than 2km for the one closer and around 2.9km for the one furthest. 

The link will be used to transmit the video feed of 1 (or even possibly two) IP cameras and some kind of Ethernet-enabled environmental or weather sensor. I have checked the necessary b/w for the cameras and both 900Mhz and 5.8Ghz are more than adequate for even 4 of them, much more for 2. I have also verified that there is clear line-of-sight to both possible installation points and that the 60% Fresnel Zone clearance is more than covered. Bear in mind that this is my first long distance link (long with or without quotes) and I hate to admit that wireless physics is far from my strong suit.

The ultimate point of my question is that although I have read a lot about frequency choice the last few days, I continue to find some ambiguity (I know it is just me that finds it ambiguous). Most sources, like this one, agree that although the lower frequencies have less losses over a given distance (free-space-loss I learned it is called) they need larger antennae for the same ""strength"" of trasmission (is ""gain"" really the same as ""strength""?). 

So, for the given distance of 2-3km and given also that all typical requirements are met, which is preferable (or do I dare say ""better"") frequency? Should I choose 900Mhz with a relatively ""small"" antenna on the basis that 3km is not really ""long distance"" and that it will provide a link with less attenuation ergo less retransmits ergo higher overall speed? Or should I choose the 5.8Ghz option for the superior b/w (I am still not very sure about this, please correct me if wrong) on the basis that at this distance there is no real difference so why not take the ""better"" one?

On a side note, should I stay to the beaten path of true WiFi or should I consider proprietary bridging solutions like the ones from Ubiquiti? I have a lot of experience with their Access Points and am really satisfied, so I would not mind integrating one more of their products in my client. In any case, I am looking for an optimal solution, choice of vendor is of very little concern at this point.

Forgive my ignorance and the possible mistaken use of language. 

UPDATE:
I arranged to have a spectrum analyzer on loan for a couple of days. I will make sure that the 900Mhz band is reasonably clear and proceed down that way.

UPDATE 2:
I had the aforementioned equipment available to play with for a day and a half. The conclusive finding is that the 9Mhz band is almost ""empty"" in the area, as one suggested here, so that takes care for the frequency choice issue. 

Concerning the equipment now, I am going with Ubiquiti AirMax Yagi antennae and matching RM900 2x2 radios. Preliminary testing on my part and from the client's employees shows that performance exceeds expectations. 

On a side note, the chosen ""lot"" is the one that is 3km away. 
",dsljanus,https://serverfault.com/users/181235,"3km is approaching the limit of 5.8GHz equipment with reasonable size antennas and typical WiFi radios. With some of the best equipment you can only get ten times that distance with some caveats.

900MHz can easily go 3km, and much much farther. 900MHz is used for a wide variety of devices for this reason, so there's a good level of background noise. This might be a problem, especially if your neighbor has a 900MHz phone or similar (not a popular frequency for phones these days, but people hold on to technology for a long time too). I would avoid this frequency unless you're in the middle of nowhere (which you aren't). The 2.4GHz spectrum has worse problems with this, our microwave at work blasts 2.4GHz (I'm sure it violates FCC something or other, but nobody really cares as we have 5GHz WiFi).

Why is Kosher salt better to use?
",Archey,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/15419,"The reason people choose Kosher/Sea/Rock salt over table salt is mainly down to the crystal size and the lack of additives like iodine.

Kosher salt is less soluble and less dense than table salt.

The large crystals in these salts mean that unless there is a fair bit of water present they don't completely dissolve. This means it is less likely you'll over salt steak even if it's caked in crystals.

Table salt will dissolve with far less water present and will, therefore, get absorbed more easily into the meat. 

Also the lower density means you can liberality sprinkle Kosher/Sea/Rock salt on things and even if it does all dissolve you've actualy added less salt than you would think. It looks like a lot but 1g of Kosher/Sea/Rock salt takes up a lot more space than 1g of table salt.

1tsp table salt would be way too much. I'd go for about half the volume of Kosher salt if you were dissolving it in liquid and maybe as little as quarter the volume if I was using it as a rub (as in salting a steak).

698,886,question and answer 1406,Are human males and females more genetically different than members of other species?,"I'm looking at this Ted talk about a Saudi Arabia woman who dared to drive a car in the last few years. This reminds me that until the last century or so, women (all over the world?) enjoyed less rights and might've been pigeonholed into roles predetermined by society. Those roles might've encouraged certain traits, and discouraged others. Those who did not conform might've been punished, like the woman in the talk above received death threats and was jailed.

This sounds to me like selective pressure, did it really exist, and did it have any effect on the genetics/traits of modern women?

This makes me interested in the question - compared to other species, are men and women more genetically different because of selective pressure put on women to conform to male-dominated world for thousands of years before 19th century?
",Alex Stone,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/577,"I'm not sure I buy your premise: firstly, the degree and form of male-female differentiation in social roles has varied widely across time and culture in human history so I doubt it forms a uniform evolutionary driver such as you describe. Secondly, the degree of male-female differentiation appears to me to be much greater in species such as gorillas, lions and peacocks than it does in humans so I'm not convinced that humans would stand out on this front as a species we'd expect to have greater genetic differences.

Even so, the only genetic difference between male and female humans is the Y-chromosome. The X appears in both males and females and doesn't have exclusively female lineage so it can't acquire separate genes for male and female. The Y chromosome contains very few genes so its not capable of manifesting a major genetic gap and because there is no recombination in the Y chromosome it is not a fertile ground for new genes anyway.

So males and females have essentially the same genes. However, this isn't the whole story because how, when and whether genes are expressed is about as important as what genes are encoded anyway. It is these differences that enable big differences between the sexes not actual coding differences.

""beef"" for ""cow"", ""cattle""

I'm not aware of this separation for ""fish"", ""goat"" or ""chicken"" (Spanish has ""pollo"" and ""gallina"") and other poultry. Are these words used simply to distinguish the meat from the animal (i.e. to avoid saying ""cow meat"") or is there a psychological separation to avoid the association?

736,939,question and answer 1489,Can I use Ubuntu to diagnose hard drive or RAM problems in Windows?,"This may be a crazy question, but here goes...

My brother suggested that I could somehow use either a Ubuntu Live Boot CD or Flash drive or Kubuntu as a way to diagnose issues I'm currently having with my laptop. I'm running Windows 7 and for some reason my laptop has suddenly started freezing during Windows start up. This started immediately after I began seeing the hard drive light remaining on and my computer running very, very slowly - even though when I checked Task Manager it said that no applications or unusual processes were running at the time and CPU usage was 0%. Strange, I know.

I've used the Restore disks 3 times already, thinking maybe it was a virus, even though I run Norton 360 and it found nothing upon a full system scan. But every time I end up with Windows failing to start up at all, or it getting stuck on the ""Windows Starting"" screen for at least 15-20 minutes before it starts.

I'm at a total loss here. I'm thinking it is either a Hard drive issue or perhaps a RAM issue, but I am a total moron when it comes to the operational aspect of computers. I don't know where to begin. My brother said that if I used a flash drive of Ubuntu or Kubuntu and tried to boot from there that I would know immediately if it was my Hard drive because it wouldn't operate. I don't understand that since it wouldn't be operating off my hard drive, it would be running from the CD/flash drive.

Does anyone have any clues on what I can do to check this out? I'm tempted to buy a new hard drive and RAM, but would hate to buy something I can't return if they aren't the issue.

I'm stuck...any help would be very appreciated. Thanks so much and have a wonderful weekend.

Simple, right?

Good old Cisco.

The ""Static"" command tells the pix that the internal machine is attached to the external address, so that it will route traffic accordingly.

The ""access-list"" command tells the pix that you're creating a new access-list, you're allowing or denying ""any"" external machine to talk to your new external address on (port number) using tcp or udp packets.

The access-group command associates that access-list with an interface on the pix.

Here is a link to Cisco's Pix Command Reference for Commands starting with A. You can refer to that, if you need to. There is an example command under ""access-group"".

To wholly open a port for any machine you should do:

access-list open_port_whatever permit tcp any any eq (port number)

",dhblah,https://askubuntu.com/users/12185,"vncviewer allows to specify the display number in the connection string:


  If you run the viewer with no arguments it will prompt you for a VNC

  argument, e.g.:  vncviewer snoopy:2
  
  where 'snoopy' is the name of the machine, and '2' is the display
  number of the VNC server on that machine. Either the machine name or
  display number can be omitted. So for example "":1"" means display
  number 1 on the same machine, and ""snoopy"" means ""snoopy:0"" i.e.
  display 0 on machine ""snoopy"". 


Source: manpage for vncviewer

I could not find an explicit option in Remmina to specify display number, however:


  By default, a VNC server will listen for connections from a VNC viewer
  on TCP port ""5900+N"", where N is the ""Display Number"" (usually just
  zero). So a VNC server setup for Display-0 will listen on TCP-5900,
  Display-1 is TCP-5901, etc.
  
  Additionally, the VNC server will listen for connections from a
  web-browser on TCP port ""5800+N"", where N is as above. If you point a
  web-browser to this port, the VNC server will automatically provide a
  Java VNC viewer that runs right in your web-browser. This Java Viewer
  will then exchange data with the VNC Server on the same ports a normal
  VNC Viewer would use: ""5900+N"".

Basically the timestamp is divided into 4 columns - DATE, TIME, SECONDS and NANOSECONDS.
I'd like to read the file as a pandas DataFrame with DATE, TIME and NANOSECONDS as datetime objects, which are used as index:

import datetime as dt
import pandas as pd

parse = lambda x: dt.datetime.strptime(x, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %f')

df = pd.read_csv('data.txt', sep='\t', parse_dates=[['DATE', 'TIME', 'NANOSECONDS']], index_col=0, date_parser=parse)


But this fails, because nanoseconds values have 9 digits instead of 6 as required by the %f format. The above code works if I manually remove the 3 extra zeroes from the values in NANOSECONDS column.
Could you please show me, how I can read-in the sample file as a pandas DataFrame object using DATE, TIME and NANOSECONDS columns as index?

[UPDATE] Using %f000 as suggested by behzad.nouri works if NANOSECONDS column doesn't contain 0 values. So, apparently this is what's causing the problem now.

    return dt.datetime.strptime(t[:-3], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %f')


is safer because it appends zeros before the number; basically it is making sure the nanosecond value has 9 digits, and then drops the last 3;

773,982,question and answer 1554,Effects of nuclear explosions in space?,"In the Honor Harrington universe, ship-to-ship combat takes two forms: missiles and direct energy weapons.

Missiles come in two forms - bomb-pumped lasers and contact nukes.  Both use multi-megaton nuclear initiations to damage enemy ships.

While this sort of event on a planetary surface will obviously have lasting effects, what long-term effects could be expected in a vacuum environment, aside from the destructive force associated with the explosions themselves, and the resulting EMP?  Especially, would there be lingering (or spreading) radiation?
",Jeff,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/656,"The biggest hazard would have to be any macroscopic particles left over. 

Gamma rays, X-rays, and other ionizing radiation would spread out at the speed of light, or nearly so for electrons, alphas, etc., and within moments be less than the radiation that always present in space. After an hour, any such radiation will be smeared out to a volume as large as the orbit of Jupiter. I.e., it's effectively gone. You'd have to worry more about minor solar flares than space nukes.

On the other hand, although most of what's in the immediate vicinity of the explosion would be vaporised to atoms (or parts thereof), it seems possible that you could end up with significant amounts of debris. Perhaps the solar wind would blow the smaller ones away, much like the effect with a comet, but some of the larger chunks would present major navigational hazards. NASA gets very concerned when millimeter sized bits float away in orbit. Obviously anything larger will be more of a concern. If you're moving around at planetary speeds, 10's of km/sec, the kinetic energy in such space junk could easily put a hole your hull.

How would you put a minimum MSE criteria on how well the estimated filter weights matched the actual transfer function of the system? [Suppose you needed the MSE to be no more than -50dB]?
How would you change his formulation if you wanted poles as well as zeroes (an IIR rather than an FIR filter)?

",Seth,https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/5843,"
The desired MSE is application dependent, so there can be no general
rule. If the approximation doesn't satisfy your needs you can
increase the filter length to obtain a better match.
There is no straightforward way to change the FIR Wiener filter solution to an IIR solution because the IIR formulation results in a set of nonlinear equations which have no closed-form solution. The IIR solution might also be unstable, so FIR filters are a much more practical choice when computing a Wiener filter.

Without your monitors plugged in, right-click on your desktop, hover over ""View"" and turn off the feature ""Align icons to grid""
Plug in your monitor and proceed only if your icons remain in their original positions
Turn ""Align icons to grid"" back on the same way you turned it off.


Using the steps above, this should allow you to unplug/turn-off monitors and replug/turn-on monitors without your icons moving all over the place.

I noticed with this, however, that it's save-file-like and you will need to redo the steps if you want to move icons around. I tested this by unplugging my monitor, moving an icon (without changing the grid feature) and plugging my monitor back in. I observed that the icon returned to its original position on my desktop as it was before I moved it and the rest of my icons stayed in the same spot. I then unplugged my monitor and found that icon to move to where I originally moved it to, so I turned the grid feature off, plugged in my monitor and then turned the grid feature back on and found the icon to stay in its new position.

839,1064,question and answer 1675,Are Mintakans related to Vulcans?,"In TNG ""Who Watches the Watchers"" we learn about the Mintakans, who are described as ""proto-Vulcan humanoids"".  Does this mean that the Mintakans come from a common ancestor to the Vulcans, or does it mean that the two species have evolved coincidentally to share many of the same features? (Or not so coincidentally if you take into account that genetic-seeding by the super ancient humanoids.)

We have been shown many species that look completely like humans, and even entire planets that mirror Earth (TOS ""Miri"") and maybe some of those species could be considered ""proto-human humanoids"".

I don't think it has been defined how long Vulcans have had space travel, or if it's even possible the Vulcans evolved from some other species that had space travel earlier, and the Mintakans are some off-shoot of that species.  This could possibly be justified from what Spock says in TOS ""Return to Tomorrow"" where he seems to suggest in response to Sargon and the astrobiology doctor that there are unexplained issues with Vulcans evolving on the planet Vulcan, that they might have been colonized by Sargon's people instead.

Interesting reading:
http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Vulcan_history
",Sean Fahey,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/19629,"Nobody knows.

In ""Return to Tomorrow"" Spock speculated that Vulcans might be descended from Sargon's people more than 600,000 years ago. In any case there might be descendants of other colonies of Sargon's people on other planets, who would look a lot like Sargon's people - whose biological bodies were never seen  but believed by Sargon to resemble Earth Humans or Vulcans.

""Balance of terror"" implies that Vulcan conquered and colonized other planets once, and Romulans seemed to be descendants of those warlike and unreformed ancient Vulcans. It is logical to assume that society on Vulcan and Romulus reverted to barbarism as civilization collapsed during the fall of the Vulcan Empire and it took countless thousands of years for Vulcan and Romulus to rebuild civilization and become space traveling societies again.

STTNG ""Gambit"" mentions ruins of Romulan off-shoot cultures on various planets one being two thousand years old. Thus we may deduce that probably the Romulans regain spaceflight abilities several thousand years ago and later lost them and regained them again just a few centuries ago.

Of course many fans believe in a far different chronology based on Diane Duane's novels, with Vulcan and Romulus both keeping interstellar travel abilities for over two thousand years until the time of STTNG. But that contradicts the chronological implications of the various episodes.

In ""The Paradise Syndrome""  Spock mentions that some Vulcan offshoot cultures use musical notation alphabets. That implies that there were at least two known ones which did so and at least one known one which did not.

The people of Rigel V might be descended from Vulcans and/or Sargon's people, since in ""Journey to Babel"" it was said that their physiology was similar to, but not identical with, Vulcan physiology.

And that is about all the information available to decide whether the Mintakans are descended from Vulcans and/or Sargon's b people or evolved independently to be similar to Vulcans.

Except of course that it hardly needs saying that a planet orbiting a star such as Mintaka would not have time to evolve intelligent life and the Mintakans and/or their planet must have been imported from elsewhere, perhaps by the Preservers.

852,1082,question and answer 1710,Preventing player passivity in GUMSHOE?,"I really like the game worlds of the various GUMSHOE games I have (Fear Itself, Esoterrorists, Mutant City Blues) but haven't run it yet.  My big concern is that I've seen the ""ablative skill system"" kind of mechanic work very poorly in other games - players hoard their ""uses,"" or use them all and then sit on their hands during the latter part of the game session because they know they're not going to be able to succeed at anything and trying will just get them killed.  

In GUMSHOE, your skills are a ""pool"" of points that you spend either for benefits or for adds to the dice when testing.  You basically roll d6 + spend vs a difficulty, typically 4 for general stuff but often going higher.  Fighting works the same way, so if you have a Scuffling pool of 8, once you've used them all, you know you won't live through any meaningful combat.  

For those that have run GUMSHOE or similar ablative systems, do you find that happening, and what are ways to avoid it?  I mean, I don't mind trying to capture the ""downward spiral"" but it risks characters just checking out if they don't think whatever plot is at hand is really worth all their lives.  ""Let's try to save her next session..."" 
",mxyzplk,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/140,"It seems to me that there are a number of things that you could do to help ameliorate this sort of risk.

The first would be to allow ablative skills to regenerate more frequently rather than just at the start of a session. If you intend to have a couple of scenes in a session which require the same skills (such as a combat), allow the PCs to regenerate their skills between. This would allow for the drama of getting tired (running out of points) during a scene, without that scene affecting others. Depending on how finely tuned GUMSHOE is however, this could be unbalancing.

Another option would be to reward ingenuity, good tactics, good role-playing or heroism etc. with point pool replenishments after or even during the scene. Since it's more under your control, it should be less prone to unbalancing the game.

I have seen this sort of thing with players in card based systems like SAGA, but only with relatively new players. Once you've played SAGA for a while you realise that the best thing you can do with a hand of low cards is to play them and hope to draw better cards, so any solution to this problem is likely to involve players being encouraged to be more active, more inventive, more dramatic when they get down to fewer pool points.

I know my thoughts are rather general, since I haven't played GUMSHOE, but I hope they were useful nevertheless.

The $uud$ proton and $udd$ neutron are both spin 1/2, implying that two of their spin 1/2 quarks are always parallel and the other is always opposed.

In contrast, the $\Delta^+$ particle (which like the proton is $uud$) and the $\Delta^0$ particle (which like the neutron is $udd$) are both spin 3/2, implying presumably that the same principle keeps their internal quark spins all parallel.

What principle keeps trios of quarks aligned or anti-aligned in such specific ways?
",Terry Bollinger,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/7670,"The question is ""what maintains the orientation"". What maintains it is simply the angular momentum conservation. If the total angular momentum has $J^2=j(j+1)\hbar^2$ for $j=1/2$ or $j=3/2$, it obviously can't change because the whole vector $\vec J$ (including its length) is conserved. An up-spin may not spontaneously change to a down-spin and there is no value in between.

The quantum mechanical problem for the bound state of quarks has, much like similar problems for atoms, some solutions with various values of the spin. Just like in atomic physics, the symmetry or antisymmetry of the orbital part of the wave function is correlated with the wave function for the spins, and therefore with the total spin, in various ways to guarantee that the overall wave function is antisymmetric. Some of these solutions have $j=1/2$, others have $j=3/2$. There are no other values of spins one may get by combining three $j=1/2$ spins.

866,1096,question and answer 1728,How does our work on this earth transfer into the new earth when God returns?,"I recently read Every Good Endeavor by Tim Keller and also Surprised by Hope by N.T. Wright.  Both are amazing books, focused on the resurrection theology that God will raise up a new heaven and a new earth, and we will dwell in the presence of God, not just sitting around, but living life with new redeemed bodies and doing redeemed work that isn't corrupted by sin.

The ideas of heaven are very exciting: that we won't be just sitting around playing harps, but will live much like we do currently, although without the corruption of sin and in the presence of God.

Another exciting theme in these books is that the work we do here matters towards the new heaven and new earth, and will be redeemed and made full when God comes.  While this is exciting to me, it is also very confusing. Can anybody shed some light into how the work we do here transfers to Gods kingdom, even if it is ""secular"" in nature?

  John 3:5,6 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.


Jesus here is instructing Nicodemus, which in verse 10 He says: “Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?”  The interesting thing here is that Jesus is chastising Nicodemus for not knowing that one has to be “born again” before His (Christ’s) completed work on the cross.

In the book of Hebrews chapter 11 we know that those that lived before the cross received a good report by faith. 


  Revelation 20:12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
  
  First Corinthians 3:13-15 Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.


The Book of Life appears to be an eternal genealogy, where the “books” seem to record ones life works, either born of the Holy Spirit or conceived and born outside of the will of God the Father and of the Holy Spirit. 

So in answer to the question: Fire is the agent that separates eternal substance from temporal substance, this is also true with our life works as well.  Fire typically depicts God's judgement.

868,1100,question and answer 1733,How do electrical devices suck electricity?,"If the electric potential is 220V and some device needs 1500watts then how does it suck exactly that amount of electrical energy from outlet?
",Ron,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/7253,"If it's a light bulb or heater, it's just a resistor.

First, forget that it's alternating current, just to simplify things.
Think of the power source as a really big 220 volt battery.

If it's drawing 1500 watts, divide that by 220, and that will tell you the current I in Amperes.
(That just measures how many electrons per second are flowing. An Ampere is about 6x10^23 electrons per second.)

To get the resistance R in Ohms, just divide the voltage V (220 volts) by the current I that you got above.
(An Ohm is just the number of volts it takes to push one Ampere through the resistor.)

I hope you can see that the smaller the resistance is, the bigger the current is, and when you multiply that by the voltage, you get the power.

So the way you make a bigger heater or light bulb is by giving it less electrical resistance.

If you want to go back to alternating current (AC) the power is a time-average, and it swings up and down at twice the AC frequency.
I'll let you figure out why, if you want.

Janna is also vary strong when facing offensive champions. Her CC and shield can frustrate the enemies if well played.

Let's just think:
Zyra has no abilities for direct support and being a mage, she depends on her mana. Poking and harassing is the best way to push this kind of support back, and picking a champion with direct support will leave your carry with an advantage against Zyra's carry.

",Pati,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/60697,"The answer really depends on how you have set up your document and how you create your bibliogrphy etc (are you using bibtex, biblatex, ...?).

Any way one solution, which may or may not be appropriate is to add the following to your preamble:

\makeatletter
\def\thebibliography#1{%
  \c@chapter\z@ \c@section\z@\let\chaptername\relax
  \section*{References}\list
  {}{\settowidth\labelwidth{}\leftmargin\labelwidth

\makeatletter


Actually, this solution makes the bibliography more compact, which you mightn't like.

Another solution, that it closer is spirit to what you tried, is to modify \bibitem. If you look at the definition of \bibitem (using, for example, \show), you will see that it calls \@bibtem and this is where the \item command comes from. Hence, you can get what you want with the following:

\makeatletter
\def\@bibitem#1{\item[]%
    \if@filesw\immediate\write\@auxout{\string \bibcite {#1}{\the\value{\@listctr }}}\fi\ignorespaces}
\makeatletter


The difference between these two approaches is the indentation of the bibliography entries. The first attempt produces



whereas the second gives you



The first approach is the more robust and the second may have unintended side-effects, not least because it doesn't cater for the optional argument that \bibitem accepts.

891,1129,question and answer 1770,I can't find a PFET protected against ESD,"I like to use OmniFETs for MOSFETs because they have internal protection against ESD so I am unlikely to damage them while handling and then when they don't work I don't have to wonder if it was damaged or I have a circuit mistake.  These are n-channel FETs, but now I need a p-channel FET.  I tried to find one Mouser and Digikey, but was unsuccessful.  Is there such a thing?

It would basically be a MOSFET and a diode in one package.  Other things like over-current and over-temperature protection would also be nice, but are less important.
",mccoyn,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/7808,"I would like to add that it seems to me like a very futile effort to only use ESD-protected FETs. If you have a FET that is large enough to hold in your hand, it is already fairly rugged by virtue of physics. Gate and drain-source capacitance make sure that whatever charge you can inject into the device will not cause large enough voltages to spark over.

But much more importantly: when handling any other active device, you are probably holding tens, hundreds, thousands of tiny little FETs in your hand, each and every one of them orders of magnitude more sensitive to ESD. There is usually some protection on the outgoing pins, but I'm afraid that the only way to really set yourself free from the worry of ESD is to regard proper ESD safety:


Regard air humidity at all times, try to keep it high (70%+). Air humidity dissipates static charges extremely effectively.
When dealing with sensitive devices - something that is almost always mentioned in the datasheet or on the package if this is especially so - wear an ESD dissipative wrist band connected to an ESD mat, which in turn is connected to your mains electricity ground with an appropriate connector. ESD mats nowadays are very inexpensive.
Regard your clothing. Do not wear clothing with long exposed fibers (e.g. wool).


This way  you will be able to enjoy electronics with access to the full gamut of devices, instead of having to artificially limit yourself to only those which explicitly advertise ESD protection. Which doesn't guarantee you in any way that you do avoid ESD damage either!

926,1169,question and answer 1838,The Probability of Catching Criminals,"I have been struggling with the following question and would greatly appreciate any help  :)


  Suppose we have information about the supermarket purchases of 100 million people. Each person goes to the supermarket 100 times in a year and buys 10 of the 1000 items that the supermarket sells. We believe that a pair of criminals will buy exactly the same set of 10 items at some time during the year. If we search for pairs of people who have bought the same set of items, would we expect that any such people found were truly criminals? Assume our hypothesis to be that a pair of criminals will surely buy a set of 10 items in common at some time during the year. 


This is meant to be an illustration of Bonferroni's principle. Suppose there are no criminals and that everyone behaves at random. Would we find any pairs of people who appear to be criminals?

We must initially find the expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year. I'm not sure whether I do this correctly...

Here is how I've been going about solving it:

Number of possible pairs of people: $\binom{10^6}{2} = \frac{10^{12}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{11}$, using the fact that $\binom{n}{2} \approx \frac{n^2}{2}$, when $n$ is large.

Number of possible 10-item selections: $\binom{10^3}{10} \approx 2.6 \times 10^{23}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at a point in time:
$\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at least once over the course of 100 periods in time: $\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a pair buying exactly the same 10 items (both at least once) over the course of 100 periods in time: $(\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}})^2 = (\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{21}})^2 = \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}}$

The expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year is thus:

$ 5 \times 10^{11} \times \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}} = \frac{5}{6.75 \times 10^{31}}$

Because the above number is so low if we do find a pair buying the same 10 items then, under our hypothesis, they are likely to be criminals and not a false positive case. 

I am just wondering whether my solution to the above is correct?
",user1200428,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/72187,"My understanding of the problem is as follows:
Person A has 100 sets of 10 items because he went to the store 100 times in the year. Now the probability that B goes to the store and buys a set that was also bought by A is 
$$
100*\frac{1}{1000\choose 10}
$$

This was for B's one visit. The 100 that we see in the product comes from the fact that A had 100 items. Now we know B also went to the store 100 times so probability that A and B had a same set of 10 items becomes 
$$
100*\frac{1}{1000\choose 10}*100
$$

Knowing that we have 100 million people, possible pairs of A and B 
$$
{10^8\choose 2}
$$
Hence the final answer to me seems to be 
$$
100*\frac{1}{1000\choose 10}*100*{10^8\choose 2} \sim \frac{10^{20}}{10^{30}}*10\,!
$$
I would be happy to discuss the solution.

In my body text I use old-style figures for numbers, and lining figures in equations. If I use dcolumn my tables use lining figures, instead of old-style figures.

I've fiddled around with the definitions in dcolumn.sty already, but it seems to rely on math mode to get the dot 'right', so removing all the $-characters leads to breakage.
Temporarily changing the math font to use old-style figures seems to be a pretty difficult thing as well, this is all set up during the loading of the font package...

Using siunitx with \sisetup{mode=text} I do get old-style figures, but then \figureversion{tab}, which I use to switch to tabular figures, is ignored, and the figures also don't line up nicely.

I am reading Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Step by Step which I feel it is a very good book on introducing you to the C# language.

I seem to be having problems in understanding the static keyword. From what I understand this far if a class is declared static all methods and variable have to be static. The main method always is a static method so in the class that the main method exists all variables and methods are declared static if you have to call them in the main method. Also I have noticed that in order to call a static method from another class you do not need to create an object of that you can use the class name.

What are the advantages of declaring static variables and methods?

When should I declare static variable and methods?
",Nistor Alexandru,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/52164,"Here's Joshua Bloch's way of explaining it, which I find brilliant like most of what he says (yes I'm a Joshua Bloch fan boy :) ). This is quoted from memory.

Imagine that a class is the equivalent of a blue-print for a house. Image then that a house is to the blueprint as an instance of the class is for the class. You can have one class (blue-print) and multiple instances (houses) created from it.

Now common sense dictates that most of the functions/behaviors that a house (instance) can have/do, even though they are declared in the blue-print, cannot be used until an actual house (instance) is made out of that blue-print (class). Like, your blue print might contain in it the place where the light switches and the light bulbs should go, but you have no way of making those work on the blue-print, you have to actually build the house in order to be able to switch the light switch on and off and have certain light bulbs go on and off.

However, you might have some behavior that is applicable to the blue-print directly, and which you could use/access directly on the blue print without needing to make an actual house out of that blue print. Imagine that your blue-print has a button that, upon pressing, will display the footprint of the house contained in that blue print (by calculating all the lengths of the walls and such). Obviously you COULD build a house first, then go around measuring its footprint, but you can do this with he blue-print alone, so it would be more helpful to have this behavior implemented in the blue-print. Such a blue-print embedded button that calculates the footprint of the house is the equivalent of having a static function in a class.

",Sebas,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/9583,"I think the SET SESSION query_cache_type = OFF is causing this. In the Query Cache Configuration page it states: 


  If you set query_cache_type at server startup (rather than at runtime with a SET statement), only the numeric values are permitted.


And since you are starting the server with cache disabled, there is no need to use that SET anyway.

As to why it throws an error (both with = OFF and = 0), it may have to do with this note in Server System Variables page:


  
  query_cache_type  
  
  
  ...
  
  If the server is started with query_cache_type set to 0, it does not acquire the query cache mutex at all, which means that the query cache cannot be enabled at runtime and there is reduced overhead in query execution.


My interpretation is that the variable has both Global and Session scope but only if it not set to off at startup.

If you draw a cloister tile in the beginning of the game, it will typically still require an investment of quite a bit of ""meeple"" time to obtain the full 9 points, which makes it a fair trade-off. However, after about half of the game, it's relatively likely that you can ""parachute"" a cloister tile in some spot and get 8 or 9 points immediately. This adds a lot of randomness to the game.

What house rules work well to diminish this effect?
",Erik P.,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/30,"There are a couple of expansions that reduce the usefulness of cloisters. You don't get the points until all the surrounding squares are filled, which is a safe bet in 'vanilla' Carcassonne, but not such a sure thing with expansions. The Tower expansion makes it less attractive to leave meeple on the board for any length of time, because they are sitting ducks for capture by a tower. The Catapult expansion makes it possible to remove Meeple from the board, or replace them with your own. The Princess and the Dragon expansion also encourages Monk removal as dragon-food.

You could ban the 'instant cloister' case, disallowing the dropping of a cloister into a hole for an immediate 9 points. I personally don't find this a huge problem though. You have equivalent 'instant city' and 'instant road' cases. Ultimately, there is quite a lot of luck involved in Carcassonne, by design, I think.

If it is still failing then without knowing exactly what is going on in your code I would hazard a guess to say that the original image is getting disposed somewhere before it should be. That's usually the most common cause of the error.

I've written a library that handles many different imaging operations whilst ensuring that memory is correctly handled. It's well tested and very simple to use. 

You can get it here. http://imageprocessor.org/

Example code using the library:

using (ImageFactory imageFactory = new ImageFactory())
{
    // Load, resize, set the quality and save an image.
    imageFactory.Load(@""C:\a.jpg"")
                .Resize(new Size(50, 100))
                .Quality(90)
                .Save(@""C:\myimage.jpeg);

",xenoterracide,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/1015,"With questions like these, I always point to Alexandrian's Three Clue Rule essay.

http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule

As Alexandrian says, have at least three clues per thing that you want the players to figure out. And as Bankuei says, make at least some of them obvious. Generally I use two tiers when making a mystery. There are three first tier clues that point to the person/location/thing that the players need to run into. But when the players enter the mystery, what they find first are second tier clues to the first tier clues or places they can find other second tier clues.

So lets say we have a murder mystery. We come up with three first tier clues: the guy who acted as lookout while the murder was committed, the murder weapon, and the fact that the two victims knew the murderer.

We decide that we have three second tier sources of clues: The two crime scenes, and the CCTV network that one player has access to.

At the first crime scene are stab wounds that will match the murder weapon, a witness who saw the lookout and can describe him, and the matchbooks that the lookout dropped at his lookout point, which points to his favorite bar.

At the second crime scene are stab wounds that will match the murder weapon, a witness who saw where the murderer disposed of the murder weapon, and a series of emails between the murdered and murderer which shows they had business ties.

The CCTV network will show the outlook at the second crime scene, and the fact that the murderer frequently visited both victims. He looked very angry when he visited the second victim before the day before the murder.

To shore up the outlook clues, we'll also decide that the outlook is a petty crook, so his name and address can be found by finding him in the criminal database (if they know what he looks like).

Finally our first tier clues: The murder weapon has the murderer's finger prints and his initials on the grip.

The outlook can be made to spill the beans. He knows exactly who the murderer is.

And digging into the emails and other records will reveal that the three were engaged in shady business deals, where the murderer was getting the short end of the stick.

1011,1275,question and answer 2009,How the hypergeometric distribution sums to 1?,"The hypergeometric distribution is defined for $\max(0, n+K-N)\leq k\leq \min(K,n).$
But, when we use Vandermonde's identity to prove that probabilities sum to $1$, then we use the range of $0\leq k \leq n.$ I wonder how this is justified?
",Silent,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/30971,"The reference mentions that this identity is from combinatorics: that is, it counts things.  

What does it count?  Consider $N$ objects.  Once and for all, divide those $n$ things into a group of $K$ of them, which I will call ""red,"" and the remainder, which I will call ""blue.""  Each subset of $n$ such objects determines, and is determined by, its red objects and its blue objects.  The number of such sets with $k$ red objects (and therefore $n-k$ blue objects) equals the number of ways to choose $k$ red objects from all $K$ ones (written $\color{red}{\binom{K}{k}}$) times the number of ways to choose the remaining $n-k$ blue objects from all the $N-K$ ones (written $\color{blue}{\binom{N-K}{n-k}}$).

Now if $k$ is not between $0$ and $K$, then there is no $k$-element subset of $K$ things, so $\binom{K}{k}=0$ in such cases.  Similarly, $\binom{N-K}{n-k}=0$ if $n-k$ is not between $0$ and $N-K$.  (This not only makes sense, it is actually how good software will evaluate these quantities.  Ask R, for instance, to compute choose(5,6) or choose(5,-1): it will return the correct value of $0$ in both cases.)

Summing over all possible numbers $k$ shows that 

$$\binom{N}{n} = \sum_k \color{red}{\binom{K}{k}}\color{blue}{\binom{N-K}{n-k}}$$

and as you read this you should say to yourself ""any $n$ objects are comprised of some number $k$ of red objects and the remaining $n-k$ blue objects.""

The sum needs to include all $k$ for which both the terms $\color{red}{\binom{K}{k}}$ and $\color{blue}{\binom{N-K}{n-k}}$ are nonzero, but it's fine to include any other values of $k$ because they will just introduce some extra zeros into the sum, which does not change it.  We just need to make sure all relevant $k$ are included. It suffices to find an obvious lower bound for it ($0$ will do nicely and is more practicable than $-\infty$!) and an obvious upper bound ($N$ works because we cannot find more than $N$ objects altogether).  A slightly better upper bound is $n$ (because $k$ counts the red objects in a set of $n$ things).  Thus, writing these bounds explicitly and dividing both sides by $\binom{N}{n}$, we obtain

$$1 = \sum_{0\le k\le n}\frac{\color{red}{\binom{K}{k}}\color{blue}{\binom{N-K}{n-k}}}{\binom{N}{n}} .$$

Despite the notation, this formula does not implicitly assert that all values of $k$ in the range from $0$ to $n$ can occur in this distribution.  About the only reason to fiddle with the inequalities and figure out what the smallest possible range of $k$ can be would be for writing programs that loop over these values: that might save a little time adding up some zeros.

A)  The hydraulics for the convertible top are low (to the point where the top won't even start to open anymore),

Find the points of intersection (A and B) on the circles $x^2+y^2+4x-10y+20=0$ and $x^2+y^2-4x-2y+12=0$; find the equation of the line $AB$.
",John M,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/96901,"The two given equations, only the first of which is a circle, intersect at infinitely many points, not at just points $A, B$, and those points of intersection lie along a common line. It is never possible that the points of intersection of two circles are all the points on any one line. 

We can see this by solving for the points of intersection of the two equations: Since the left-hand sides of each equation is equal to zero, the left-hand sides are equal to one another. This gives us 

$$\begin{align} x^2+y^2+4x-10y+20 &amp; = x^2+y^2-4x-2y+12\\ \\  \iff 8x-8y+8&amp; =0 \\ \\ \iff y&amp; =x+1.\end{align}$$

So if there were a valid intersection, the ""intersection"" would consist of in this line. Can you see why this can not happen, given the first equation is the equation of a circle? If we had the equations of two circles, they would intersect at nowhere, or at one point (if they were tangent), or at 2 points (overlapping but not concurrent), or else at infinitely many points (if they represented the same circle.) None of those possibilities is met by these two equations. So they cannot define circles. The first does in fact define a circle (graph it to see). The second doesn't (no object has a radius of $\sqrt{-7}$, which occurs with the second equation if you complete the square to obtain the center and radius a circle would have, if it in were a circle.

On different computer builds, ASUS/GIGABYTE/MSI, I constantly have outgoing connections to XXX-XXX-XXX.deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com over HTTP Port 80, and if the connection attempts are denied, the network card (or at least internet connectivity) stops working... LAN connections still appear to work. The outgoing connections occur on every restart, and must be allowed for the network card to function properly. If the attempts are denied, the system must be restated so that the connections will be attempted again and can be allowed.

This post suggests narrowing down an offending application, but I don't see how akamai technologies can be so intertwined in so many systems, cut-off connectivity if not allowed, etc. Something about it feels like unauthorized (or at least unwanted) information transfer, at the very least a phone-home, but I have no Wirshark captures to confirm this :)

My primary guess after looking at all the symptoms: the connection attempt is trying to see if there is internet connectivity, and if the attempt fails Windows assumes there is none... But this sounds really, really dumb.

1066,1341,question and answer 2114,Questions on mass-production soldering,"Wave soldering

I am trying to understand how wave soldering works. Unfortunately the Wikipedia article has has left me unsure about the process:


Is the entire board with its components quasi-immersed in liquid solder while it passes through the wave? (If not, the following question probably make no sense.)
If the board cuts into the wave, how is the wave maintained?
Why does this not leave superflous solder residue on the board?


Double-Sided SMT soldering

How are double sided boards with SMT components soldered? How is it prevented that the components on one side fall off?
",ARF,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/8534,"wave soldering
For wave soldering the PCB passes over a bath of molten solder where the solder is pushed up so that it strikes along the bottom side of the PCB. You'll need a solder resist mask to prevent to have solder over all the copper. 

Note that also SMDs can be wave soldered, but then the orientation of the parts is important. Some parts have to be placed perpendicular to the wave direction. Fine pitch parts like 0.4 mm QFPs can't be wave soldered because all the pins will be shorted, but QFPs with a higher pitch can. They need ""solder thieves"", which are solder pads at the end of a row of pins to gather residual solder.

  

A QFP may have to be placed at a 45° angle, and will have the solder thieves at one of the corners:  



The wave direction is important during PCB layout and panelization, and the production engineer should get clear instructions on it.

reflow soldering
SMDs for two-sided placement are glued on one side. After solder paste is applied with a stencil a glue dot machine places glue dots for the parts (at an incredible rate of more than 10 per second). Then the parts are placed, the panel is flipped over, and the other side gets solder paste and component placement.

You need to actively log the queries with SQL Profiler where you can export and filter on the queries with hints. Or use server-side trace for long running traces.

You can come close by inspecting the cached execution plans. 

This will show most queries but remember that some aren't cached and that sql server can remove them from the cache if it's under pressure. Use this query to list them:

SELECT [cp].[refcounts]

a short ""ting""

if a small rock hits the down tube


I don't know what is causing this noise, but I think that it could be any of this things:


pedal
crank arm/pedal connection
crankset


I think the material of all these things is alluminium.

I don't feel anything (like a bad shifted chain) when I hear the noise.

It happens when there is movement and when there is NO movement (I use the brake, so the bike doesn'e move, stand using all weight on right pedal, and it makes the noise)

The pedals could be in any position, It is not in a particular position. Just pressing the right pedal.

Has someone else has this ""problem""? Any ideas of where this comes from?

Update:
Yesterday I took out the chain and stood on the right pedal, and made the noise. Then is not the chain, nor the transmission system.

I put oil in the pedal axis, but had no luck. Also tried to loose the pedal, but the juncture point is too tight, and I couldn't.

Today I will try to use oil in the bottom bracket.

Example:
My main domain is mainsite.com.

Then I have several sites:

site1.com that cpanel automatically associates with site1.mainsite.com and creates a folder mainsite.com/site1.com. So if I access site1.com I would see in browser site1.com but the content delivered would be the one inside the mainsite.com/site.com folder. 

This works if I don't use the .htaccess rule but I need it for routing. If I have that rule I get internal server errors everytime I access site1.com (I assume that it's a conflict between cpanel rules and .htaccess).

How can I modify the rule so that it only affects maindomain and not subdomains? I am assuming that by doing this there would be no conflict and my problem would be solved.

6) Initialize common controls in MyRegisterClass ( before return statement ) :

// initialize common controls

iccex.dwSize = sizeof(INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX);
iccex.dwICC = ICC_BAR_CLASSES | ICC_WIN95_CLASSES | 
    ICC_TAB_CLASSES | ICC_TREEVIEW_CLASSES | ICC_STANDARD_CLASSES ;

if( !InitCommonControlsEx(&amp;iccex) ) 
    MessageBeep(0);   // signal error 


That's it, for the SSCCE.

My questions are following :


How can I properly position tooltip in my main window? How should I manipulate with caret coordinates?
Is there a way for tooltip handle and toolinfo structure to not be global?


Thank you for your time.

Best regards. 

EDIT #1:

I have managed to achieve quite an improvement by deleting ScreenToClient call in the subclass procedure. The x-coordinate is good, y-coordinate could be slightly lower. I still would like to remove global variables somehow...

EDIT #2:

I was able to adjust y-coordinate by using EM_GETRECT message and setting y-coordinate to the bottom of the formatting rectangle:

RECT rcClientRect;
Edit_GetRect( hwnd, &amp;rcClientRect );
pt.y = rcClient.bottom;


Now the end-result is much better. All that is left is to remove global variables...

EDIT #3:

It seems that I have cracked it! The solution is in EM_SHOWBALLOONTIP and EM_HIDEBALLOONTIP messages! Tooltip is placed at the caret position, ballon shape is the same as the one on the picture, and it auto-dismisses itself properly. And the best thing is that I do not need global variables!

Here is my subclass procedure snippet:

case WM_CHAR:
{
    // whatever... This condition is for testing purpose only
    if( ! IsCharAlpha( wParam ) &amp;&amp; IsCharAlphaNumeric( wParam ) )
    {
        SendMessage(hwnd, EM_HIDEBALLOONTIP, 0, 0);
        return ::DefSubclassProc( hwnd, message, wParam, lParam );
    }
    else
    {
        EDITBALLOONTIP ebt;

        ebt.cbStruct = sizeof( EDITBALLOONTIP );
        ebt.pszText = L"" Tooltip text! "";
        ebt.pszTitle = L"" Tooltip title!!! "";
        ebt.ttiIcon = TTI_ERROR_LARGE;    // tooltip icon

        SendMessage(hwnd, EM_SHOWBALLOONTIP, 0, (LPARAM)&amp;ebt);

        return FALSE;
    }
 }
 break;

",AlwaysLearningNewStuff,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2676466,"After further testing, I have decided to put this as an answer so others can clearly spot it. 

The solution is in using EM_SHOWBALLOONTIP and EM_HIDEBALLOONTIP messages. You do not need to create tooltip and associate it to an edit control! Therefore, all I need to do now is simply subclass edit control and everything works :

LRESULT CALLBACK EditSubProc ( HWND hwnd, UINT message, 
WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam, 
UINT_PTR uIdSubclass, DWORD_PTR dwRefData )
{
    switch (message)
    {
    case WM_CHAR:
        {
            if( ! isdigit( wParam ) )  // if not a number pop a tooltip!
            {
                EDITBALLOONTIP ebt;

                ebt.cbStruct = sizeof( EDITBALLOONTIP );
                ebt.pszText = L"" Tooltip text! "";
                ebt.pszTitle = L"" Tooltip title!!! "";
                ebt.ttiIcon = TTI_ERROR_LARGE;    // tooltip icon

                SendMessage(hwnd, EM_SHOWBALLOONTIP, 0, (LPARAM)&amp;ebt);
                return FALSE;
            }
            else
            {
                SendMessage(hwnd, EM_HIDEBALLOONTIP, 0, 0);
                return ::DefSubclassProc( hwnd, message, wParam, lParam );
            }
        }
        break;
    case WM_NCDESTROY:
        ::RemoveWindowSubclass( hwnd, EditSubProc, 0 );
        return DefSubclassProc( hwnd, message, wParam, lParam);
        break;
    }
    return DefSubclassProc( hwnd, message, wParam, lParam);
} 


That's it!

I was going with the fact that the term ""the dark side of the moon"" would cause enough children to believe that it really was dark for Belief to make it so, but I'm not entirely sure that Belief works that way. Does it?
",Ness Gardna,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/7726,"It's been a long while since I played Little Fears and I never did GM it, but from what I remember Belief was a child's main defensive thing.  It also had it's negative side such as holding your breath when riding through a tunnel, or lifting your feet when riding over rail road tracks, or not stepping on cracks in the sidewalk.  All of which have some form of negative consequence which can have a regional component in some cases.

Judging by your wording of the question, ""would cause enough children to believe that"", it sounds you may want to impose a threshold of some kind on the plot.  From what I remember, you don't need to go that far.  Only one believer would be needed to make it happen.  But children that didn't believe, say because they never heard of the possibility, would not be subject to the effect.  The beautiful thing is that once a group of children hear about something, some of them will believe.  A real life example of that being a young sibling of my friend believed I had a battery in my big toe.  Why?  I said I did.  It was that simple.  In the same way, agents of Closetland could spread negative believes that serve one of the seven kings or whatever master the agent follows.  If you get to them young enough they will believe some really wild stories.  

Have fun with Little Fears, I may have to go looking for it again.

1136,1426,question and answer 2238,"How can I organise photos on a network storage device, and what software can help me?","I have a recently bought a NAS and am in the process of transferring my photo collection onto it. I probably have over 300GB of pictures (many in various RAW formats). At the moment these are just organized in “old fashioned” file structures but I have am hoping to improve this to a some sort of cross referenced tagging system. So far though I am running into a few problems and any help would be appreciated. I have tried using the following software:


Windows photo gallery - and this appears to rapidly retrieve photos from the NAS based on chose tag words. The main down side that I have found so far is that the windows camera codec does not yet support my S95 RAW files and so they are not visible. 
Picasa – this looks as though it might work well on a local drive (and certainly get good reviews) but I am finding it very slow when scanning the photo library on the NAS (even when left for a number of hours the scan in only approx. 5% complete!). I can live with a bit of a delay when using the NAS but this is unworkable - am I getting something wrong?
Various other photo viewers - Although they allow me to see my RAW files do not appear to support tagging and the development of a cross referenced library. 


I am also considering looking at getting Lightroom but don’t want to shell out the money only to find it is as slow as Picasa.

Finally, my ideal would be to have different layers of tags so for example I could tag all my pictures from the “Lake District” but then also have the option of sub dividing within this category based on the valley etc. Without different levels of tagging I risk winding up with an unwieldy list of tag words. I do not know if this is possible/normal but if anyone has any points about what software packages support this arrangement that would also be appreciated. 
",Colin,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/7943,"Lightroom is the way to go. Download the trial and give it a try, though I do recommend reading a bit or watching a few videos first to get the most out of your trial. 

Lightroom will let you do whatever you wish on the file system side, and then offer flexibility beyond it. This is important, because this NAS won't be your last, and in fact, you may have more than one eventually.  Lightroom does not care where your images are, and even functions with them offline (though not as well).

By arranging things on your harddrive, you are providing information about your images that will be lost when your images are separated from your hardrive, such as posting onto Flickr. The info is useful to you...I do understand that. However, the fact that the image came from ""2010/Christmas2010"" will not transfer to your Flickr upload, so it is important that you leverage something else, in particular keywords and tags that can be embedded into the image.

You can arrange your photos however you wish on the hard drive (date, event, or one big directory if you wish) and then in Lightroom create collections, tags, keywords and even what are called 'smart collections' that dynamically add images. You can tag images with keywords that will write to EXIF/IPTC, and use Lightroom's filters and search to show you related images. However it can be a bit of a pain to constantly search and filter, so Lightroom offers Collections, which are 'virtual directories' that contain images you have assigned to them. Of course, these have no relation to the actual directories on your hard drive, which is nice...you no longer have to worry about this aspect of organizing. And finally, there are Smart Collections, or virtual directories that are dynamic and automatic, so for example, you can create a Smart Collection based on certain keywords. Every new image with that keyword will be automatically added to the Smart Collection.

I find it helpful to have my images in directories related to year, then by day that I took the image: (2010/2010-12-25), because I recall when I took photos. Lightroom does this for me with its import utility. I simply tell Lightroom how I want to import, and it does automatically every time. Then, I tag images with keywords, typically related to events or subjects. If I have a particular event or project, I will create a collection to make it easy to return to (vs searching or filtering the view). For some items I create smart collections that are dynamic, such as images of family members.

When I upload to Smugmug, all the tags and keywords stay with the image, and they are easy to find on Smugmug as well.

Give Lightroom a try.

So my questions are:


In the PSInputHandler.m class, I wasn't so sure about how to get input from the command line. I read that fgets() is a potential alternative to scanf(), but is there any reason for me to use one over the other?
The method in PSBoard.m that checks for a winner, checkForWinner, is very long. Is there a simplified design I can use to shorten it?
I struggled to name the playerUp method, which returns the player whose turn it is. Is there a more suitable name?
When the user inputs which row and column to place an X or O in, I made it so that the coordinates they enter are from 1 to the number of rows and not 0 to the number of rows minus one (like with zero-based array indexing). Is this more user-friendly, or should I change it to zero-based indexing?
In PSPlayer.m, I use nested ternary operators. Is this too hard to understand? Should I change it to if statements?

When getting the user's input for how many rows and columns to use, which I expect to be an integer, how can I sanitize the input so that the program doesn't crash when a string (for example) is inputted?



Any other critique welcome!
",pasawaya,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/24129,"I will update this post over the weekend as I go through your question more and come up with some examples to iterate over my points, but I thought for now, I'd answer some of the easier questions.



Question 1.

I'm not sure and cannot remember (I will try to find out).  At the end of the day, you might consider implementing this with a GUI.  If you're using Xcode, it's quite easy to develop a GUI for either OSX or iOS, and most of your logic is already in place.  You'd just have to write the logic to hook the GUI up to the business logic.



Question 2.

One immediate thought on speeding up this process would be to use a flag to mark whether or not a row/column is a potential winner.  AND, if you do find a row that's a winner, immediately return the winner.

For a row to be a winner, every piece in the row must belong to the same player, correct?  So set the owner of the piece in the first box, and check every box.  As soon as you get to a box that doesn't match the first box, break;.  You don't need to check any more boxes in that row/column/diagonal.  You can move to the next row/column/diagonal.  And if you get to the end of the inner loop and haven't had to break; because you've found the winner, then you can set the winner and return; and stop checking.  

So basically, refactor into something more like this:

for(NSUInteger row = 0; row &lt; self.rows; row++) {

    PSPlayer *playerInFirstColumn = [self playerAtRow:row column:0];
    BOOL winnerFound;

    for(NSUInteger column = 0; column &lt; self.columns; column++) {
        if(![[self playerAtRow:row column:column] isEqualTo:playerInFirstColumn]) {
            winnerFound = false;
            break;
        } else {
            winnerFound = true;
        }
    }

    if (winnerFound) {
        self.winner = playerInFirstColumn;
        return;
    }
}


This will improve performance some.  You can probably still do better, but this is still a drastic improvement, especially for exceptionally large boards.

Now... the BEST performance improvement I can think of would actually mean you're running this check after every turn (which you're already doing, right?).  In this case, you only need to check ONE row, ONE column, and ZERO, ONE, or TWO diagonals.  And this would be a massive performance boost.  You only need to check a the row the piece was played in, the column the piece was played in, and the diagonal the piece was played in.  Every other row, column, and diagonal has been checked on a previous turn and a winner was not found otherwise the game would be over and we wouldn't've had this turn. 

AND, even if we modified the rules to continue playing after a winner has been found, you can just use an array to keep track of each row and column and diagonal and who won that row/column/diagonal, and still only need to check the relevant rows (and only check them for the player who played the piece).



Question 3.

playerUp is probably an alright method name.  Maybe activePlayer?  If you feel it's not descriptive enough, don't hesitate to leave a comment explaining it.  // returns the player whose turn it is



Question 4.

As a programmer, I am used to 0-based indexing systems, but your assumption is correct.  Most people who use programs aren't programs and would be more comfortable with a 1-based coordinate system.  Though... back to question 1... if this were given a GUI, it wouldn't matter.  ;)



Question 5.

Personally, I hate the ternary operators and never use them.  Whether or not they're acceptable would depend largely on who you're working with though.  In this case, it's a simple one.  Again, personally, I hate them and I wouldn't use it, because I never use it, but this one is simple enough that if you and everyone working on the project are comfortable with them, then go ahead and keep it.

Question 5.1.

The exact way you want to handle non-number input is an implementation detail that'd be up to you.  Do you want to request another input?  Do you want to just strip out the non-numbers and use the numbers that are there?

But as for actually checking the string itself, once you've got it into an NSString, it's quite easy:

NSCharacterSet *nonNumbers = [[NSCharacterSet 
    decimalDigitCharacterSet] invertedSet];

if([yourString rangeOfCharactersFromSet:nonNumbers].location == NSNotFound) {
    // string is all numbers and is good to go
} else {
    // string contains non-number characters
}

1166,1463,question and answer 2304,Why does playing the piano give me a pain in the neck?,"I have a keyboard set up with a proper stool so my arms are held straight out, with music at eye level - almost identical to how I set up my PC for good posture.

But while I can use the PC all day with no issues, within 5 minutes of playing the keyboard - I'm just starting - I get stiffness pain at the bottom of my neck, probably one vertebra above the shoulders.

Can anyone advise what is causing this and how to adjust? I think my main posture can't be too bad - I'm not hunching or craning my neck - but wondered if perhaps I am 'clenching' somehow?
",Mr. Boy,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/15313,"I'm a violinist, not a pianist, but it's very common for beginning violin players to have severe pain because they are too tense, especially when they are self taught.  I'm going to suggest a few generic techniques to start minimizing tension.


When you sit down at the piano, think about how you are sitting.
Look for any tension, especially in your neck and shoulders. Close
your eyes, and take a few deep, slow breaths to help you relax.
Play a note. Not a piece, or even a scale, just a single note.
Think about how relaxed you feel playing that note. Think about
tension in your back and shoulders. If you find any, slow down again
and relax. Now try two notes, or maybe even three or four. But still
think about relaxing, not about music. This is what your body should
feel like all the time when you play.
Now you've got a baseline for how you should feel while playing.
So play something simple. Either a short tune you know well, or a
scale, or whatever you find easy. Halfway through, stop and think
about tension. Did you tense up again? If you did, sit back, relax,
and start over, slower. Slowing down makes it easier to play, and
easier to think about not getting tense.
Another exercise is to practice breathing while playing. A lot of
beginners tend to hold their breathe, which just adds stress and
tension. So play a scale. Depending on your speed, you may want to
breathe in going up, and out going down, or breathe in for 4 notes,
out for 4 notes. Just practice breathing in rhythm, and being aware
of your breathe. When you are playing music, start thinking about
when you breathe in general. Breathing exercises aren't just for
singers.


In summary: Consciously relax before playing, and check for tension as you play. If you get tense, back off, relax, and slow down. Make sure you breathe.

If the tension is caused more by your posture, you may need to find a teacher to help you out, since we can't see how you hold yourself over the net. A teacher could also help with the sort of tension issues I'm talking about here, so if lessons are an option, it would probably be worthwhile, even if only for a short time.

i have updated server2 and patched it. I have also joined the domain as member server and set up the raid structure. I have also moved the data over to the right spot. BUT here is what i am not 100% sure on.

The company wants to keep the old name of ""server"", i did not want to do that and was thinking of just making a cname alias in AD DNS forward lookup zone to point to the new ip address of server2 but you can reference it as server. In order to do the alias i would naturally remove or rename the old server or just unjoin it from the domain altogether.

I have read that you can just rename a computer to a previous name in AD as long as you have unjoined and removed it from the appropirate list under Active Directory? Can i just rename a server that is a member server in a domain? Do i have to change the sid or run newsid?

Just looking for some best practices.
thanks in advance.

",dasko,https://serverfault.com/users/90428,"I am assuming that SERVER and SERVER2 are both member server computers and not domain controller computers.

When I replace old server computers I try and assign the name of the old server computer I'm replacing to the new machine. This is a common practice. (If you're consolidating servers then that's a a whole different ""can of worms"".)

There's no problem with renaming a domain member server computer after it's joined to the domain. (Supposedly you can rename domain controllers in the Server 2008 version of Active Directory, but I haven't tried it yet.) Of course, in the case of re-using a name that was already assigned to another computer, you'll want to either take the original computer holding that name offline or rename it.

I've done what you're describing many, many times with various versions of Windows. From the point you've described, I'd rename ""SERVER"" to ""OLDSERVER"", and ""SERVER2"" to ""SERVER"", leaving both joined to the domain throughout the process. You don't have to disjoin ""SERVER"" from the domain in this process. Once you've renamed ""SERVER"" while joined to the domain to ""OLDSERVER"", the object in the AD previously named ""SERVER"" will change to ""OLDSERVER"", freeing the name ""SERVER"" to be assigned to ""SERVER2"".

As an aside: I have no idea why you'd be running ""newsid"" unless you installed the system from a disk image (and even then, you should be using SYSPREP to change the SID). You don't need to regnerate the SID unless the SID is a duplicate of another machine's (like if the machine is a disk cloned image of another machine).

A friend brought up the following usage, which seems wrong, but I can't pinpoint exactly what is wrong. ""Matter of factly, I don't know. I know from my dad's experience.""

What's the view on this?

Couple of points:


The adjective form ""As a matter of fact, I don't know. ..."" seems correct.
Similar usage of literally works: ""I literally don't know."" or ""Literally, I don't know""

1185,1483,question and answer 2332,Why won't osm2po setup table correctly?,"OK, I have no idea what's going on. I'm using a Mac and successfully installed pgRouting. I used osm2po on some data, which created a sql file. I imported the sql file into a pgRouting database and all is well, except the fact I only took into account routes for cars.

After Carsten helped me with configuring osm2po.config, I ran osm2po again that ran as expected.

From the terminal, I run the command:

psql -U [username] -d [dbname] -q -f ""/Users/John/Desktop/osm2po-4.6.9/wmCar/wmCar/wmCar_2po_4pgr.sql


I was expecting it to be successful like last time, as to my knowledge the conditions are the same. However I get the error:

With pgAdmin I look at the empty table that was created, and compared to the first sql file I imported, the new table was missing a column. That being geom_way. I find this odd as I haven't changed anything. I threw osm2po folder to the trash, and unzipped a new osm2po folder. To test whether it was going to work, I ran osm2po on the original pbf file with the original osm2po.config settings and tried to import that into the same pgRouting database. The error appeared again. For some reason, the last column, geom_way, isn't being added to the table.

Would anyone know why it's started doing this?

",Majestro,https://askubuntu.com/users/132199,"I moved from 12.04 64bit to 12.1064bit on my desktop machine and run 12.04Lts on my servers.

From a technical aspect?..  I don't have enough reliable technical knowledge to offer any advice that would be constructive.

From a usability perspective.  12.10 seems smoother and a little sharper.  It's video is more polished.  On my 64bit 3.0ghz 8gb ram Dell 780 desktop it's beautifully smooth.

The 12.04 seemed a little more stable, with the qualifier that I play a little and have destroyed more installs than I can remember :)

I'm using Unity at home and xcfe at work after going through KDE, LXDE (this is worth having a look at with lower than 4gb ram machines) and Gnome.

You can install gnome desktop on any of the Ubuntu flavours, but a direct download and install is more convenient and a little tighter integrated. KUbuntu(kde), XUbuntu(Xfce) LUbuntu(Lxde).

Can I  suggest you download a few and make some bootable cd's, give 'em a whirl and see what you think?  If your still unsure you can install different desktop environments through out the different Ubuntu flavours.

I've warmed to Unity, but as it turns out with customisations all over the place, it now looks and behaves more like a mac (after spending 20 years on windows), go figure! :)

Always remember,  Linux can't be judged as an ""operating system"" in the same vane windows is. It's actually a usability experience.  You can do what ever your imagination can conjure, including customising the environment you work to an unrecognisable point.

Linux enables you to run a $50 Rasberry Pi as a home media server, or run a Particle Accelerator buried under Switzerland and go hunting for Higgs particles :)  I'd be guessing you and I somewhere between :)  Which gives us enormous choice.

Go Play!

Quick tip!  Run at least 2 partitions!  one as a home partition and one for boot.

After trashing so many installs (Entirely my fault, nothing to do with Ubuntu or Linux. I poke screw drivers into light sockets :) )  Having your /home directory on a separate partition is a god send! :)  And do backups!  Damn it!

What is the difference and when do we decide which one to use?

I feel both give us the site collection object.

Example: SPWeb spweb=spsite1.RootWeb; will mean same as spsite2.RootWeb;  Then why are there 2 ways to do it?
",variable,https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/users/21463,"SPSite spsite1=new SPSite(SPContext.Current.Web.Url); will give you SPSite object. But it will be site collection object only when SPContext.Current.Web.Url is that of root web. If the web object is that of a sub site then SPSite object won't be a site collection object. The second statement SPSite spsite2=new SPSite(SPContext.Current.Site); is wrong because there is no overload of SPSite which has SPSite as parameter.   

UPDATE

If the intention is to get the rootweb then second is a better way of doing it as you are not instantiating a new SPSite object. Moreover, in the first case you will need to dispose SPSite object as you are creating a new one compared to second in which SPSite is retrieved through SPContext which should not be disposed explicitly.

How to change base_url settings with mysql from the command line


Log into your MySQL database, replace $USER with your database user name and $DBASE with your database name. It will prompt you for your password:


mysql -u $USER -p $DBASE


Below are the SQL commands to change your base_url values. Replace unsecure http://www.mydomain.com/ and secure https://www.mydomain.com/ (if you have SSL/TLS enabled, else https should be http) with your appropriate domain url (trailing slash necessary) and if you’ve installed in a subfolder append it with a / after it.


SQL Commands

UPDATE core_config_data SET value = 'http://www.example.com/' WHERE path LIKE 'web/unsecure/base_url';
UPDATE core_config_data SET value = 'https://www.example.com/' WHERE path LIKE 'web/secure/base_url';



Check your base_url settings with the following:


SQL Commands

SELECT path,value FROM core_config_data WHERE path LIKE 'web/unsecure/base%';
SELECT path,value FROM core_config_data WHERE path LIKE 'web/secure/base%';&lt;/code&gt;

I've always used very simple static routing configurations and never needed to do any multipath routing -- hence my general confusion regarding this subject. I would like to understand multicasting and anycasting better. 


What is the difference between unicast, anycast, broadcast and multicast traffic?
What situations are they generally used in and why (e.g., what applications use which method)?
How do you calculate how much broadcast traffic is too much for a given network segment or broadcast domain?
What are the security implications of allowing broadcast and multicast traffic?

",kce,https://serverfault.com/users/62491,"Anycast is not a widely accepted type of communication in IPv4, but it is present in IPv6.

Three type of communication in IPv4 are 1) Unicast, 2) Multicast 3) Broadcast.

1) IPv4 Unicast One-to-One type of communication. A network device communicates with another network device. Layer 3 address used for Unicast is IPv4 Class A, Class B, Class C addresses. Layer 2 address is a unicast MAC address.

Example: Browse a website, Download file using FTP, Connect to another device using SSH (Secure Shell) etc.

2) IPv4 Multicast One-to-many type of communication. A network device send an IPv4 data packet and it is delivered to the devices who are interested in that traffic. Layer 3 address  used for IPv4 multicast is Class D IPv4 addresses (starts from 224 to 239) Layer 2 address for IPv4 multicast starts with ""01:00:5e"".

Example: IPTV, OSPF Hello messages, EIGRP Hello messages, RIPv2 Route Updates.

3) IPv4 Broadcast One-to-All type of communication. A network device send an IPv4 data packet and it will be delivered all devices in that LAN Segment. Problem with broadcast traffic is, broadcasts disturb all devices in LAN and cause bandwidth wastage.

Example: DHCPv4 Discover messages

In IPv6, we have Unicast, Multicast and Anycast. The concept of Unicast and Multicast are same in IPv4 and IPv6, except the changes in IPv6 Layer 3 addresses used for broadcast &amp; multicast and the Layer 2 address used for multicast. Layer 2 address used for IPv6 multicast traffic starts from ""33:33:"" (in Ipv4, it is ""01:00:5e""). 

IPv6 Anycast IPv6 Anycast type of communication is used to identify an interface from a group of interfaces, which provide the same service, but near to the client in routing distance (we can compare routing distance similar to geographical distance). Anycast is possible only with the help of routing protocols.

Check the below link for more clear explanation about IPv6 Anycast.

Example,  My home is located in India, and I want to resolve the FQDN ""www.serverfault.com"" to an IP address. Consider I have three DNS servers, one located in USA, other in Canada, and other in India, all providing the same service. Better choice is the DNS server from India, because it is located near to my home. I will get a faster reply and cause less network traffic if I use the service near my place.  Anycast can find the Server which is near to my home and get the service from that Server.

Akimbo — to stand ""with hands on hips and elbows projecting outwards"", from the C15 in kenebowe, ""literally: in keen bow, that is, in a sharp curve""
Askance — to look sideways, obliquely, especially with suspicion or doubt; origin obscure.


Other words take an 'a' prefix meaning a negative:





  a- or an- [Greek a- and an- un-, non-] 
  Negative, not (abiotic,
  acaulescent, acephalia, aphasia, asexual, atrophy, anorexia).
  
  But 'a' is also used as a prefix in words that are not negative, for example his knees were all atremble. What is the meaning of 'a-' here? Could it have connections with akimbo and askance?

",Mynamite,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/33153,"This is actually a matter of general reference that should be easily explained by consulting any dictionary worthy of being called such — and certainly can be found in The Dictionary, if one would but look.

But I will explain it anyway. :)

English has at least 6 different prefixes, a-. This, however, is not one of those six.  Rather, the one you see in knees all a-tremble is actually an old preposition that we no longer use, just as it is in here we come a-wassailing, in nine lords a leaping,  and in twice a day.  

It was a variant of the preposition on that lost its -n.  The OED explains in a prep. (which is just the 8th entry in the Dictionary):


  Variant of on prep. with loss of the final consonant -n, reflecting an unstressed pronunciation of the word in proclitic use; compare an, variant of on prep., and also o, variant of on prep.  Compare a- prefix3, away adv., aright adv.
  
  The loss of final -n  in this word occurs early in terms of the developments described at N n.  and perhaps began in fixed idioms where the word was felt to be almost a prefix; compare the parallel development represented by a- prefix3. A following consonant favoured the loss of final -n  (compare discussion at N n.) and so until the 17th cent. the word was often found in complementary distribution with an, variant of on prep., which was common before vowels (with variation between the two before following h-).
  
  The separate preposition a ceased to be used in standard English after about 1700, being replaced by the full on, in, or the various prepositions which represent them in modern idiom, surviving only in a few set uses from branch  II., such as to go a begging, to set a going  (occasionally, before a vowel or h-, in form an, after an, prevocalic variant of a adj.; compare quots. 1759, 1780 at sense 11b), and in temporal distributive phrases, as twice a day, once a year, where it had been early identified with the indefinite article (see a adj.4). It also survived in a large number of combinations, where it was treated as a prefix to the governed word, and the whole as a compound adverb. 


As I said, it’s in the Dictionary.

Were you to look there, you would also see that although there is some connection between askew and askance, and several other, less common words besides, the actual origin is obscure.  The Dictionary says of askance adv.2:


  There is a whole group of words of more or less obscure origin in ask-, containing askance, askant, askew, askie, askile, askoye, askoyne, (with which compare asklent adv., aslant adv., asquint adv.,) which are more or less closely connected in sense, and seem to have influenced one another in form. They appear mostly in the 16th or end of the 15th cent., and none of them can be certainly traced up to Old English; though they can nearly all be paralleled by words in various languages, evidence is wanting as to their actual origin and their relations to one another.

If you are putting array there, it must be a renderable array. If it's not, then either:


Implode it into string. With nested arrays, it can get a bit complicated.
Put it as an element in $block['content'] array, and set $block['content']['#theme'] element to something that can theme it. More complicated, but also more versatile and cleaner solution.

My astronomy teacher says that gravity is (note: not like) a 3D blanket and when you put mass on it, the mass causes a dip/dent in the blanket and so if you put another object with less mass it will roll down the dip onto the bigger mass. Is this true and is this what causes the centripetal force. 
",Jonathan.,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/4,"A centripetal force is a force directed towards the centre. It's just a characterisation of an existing force. ""Centripetal"" means ""towards the centre"" in Greek.

So, in the solar system, the sun exerts a gravitational force towards itself, and it is a centripetal force.

Regarding your other question: how does gravity work? According to general relativity, energetic or massive objects distort space, so that other objects passing through the distorted space do not go straight, but bend their trajectory. From their point of view, they experience a force (gravity), and consequentially an acceleration which changes their trajectory.
So according to general relativity the medium through which gravity acts is actually the distortion of space.
This is what your astronomy teacher called ""a 3D blanket"".

Instead, according to Quantum Field Theory, forces are mediated by appropriate particles actually moving through space. Gravity would be carried by particles known as gravitons.

In both these theories, there is no action-at-a-distance, so body don't exert forces on one another instantaneously, but there's always something ""in the middle"" that carries or represents the force.

1256,1568,question and answer 2463,Why did Voldemort assume that no-one knew about Room of Hidden Things?,"Voldemort hid one of his Horcruxes inside Hogwarts. It seemed to be relying on security through obscurity as far as protecting it. But as we know, it ended up not being so secure because it wasn't so obscure - Harry Potter knew about the Room of Hidden Things.

My question is, the way Rowling describes this hints at the fact that Riddle had an assumption that very few people would ever stumble upon that room. *WHY???



First, let's show Harry's theory on what Voldemort was thinking, how and why:

Here's Harry understanding Voldemort's thinking in HP7 once he figured out where the Diadem was (bold emphasis mine):


  Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant
  enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of
  Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never
  set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his
  time at school – here at least was a secret area he and Voldemort knew, that
  Dumbledore had never discovered –


...and later on, with Harry explains the location to Ron/Hermione:


  “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.”
  
  “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.
  “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry.


.



Yet, from available evidence, that seems to be a completely wrong assumption, even at Voldemort's time. 

Let's examine that last quote again, with emphasis on other info available:


  “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries.” ...
  
  ...
  
  “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.
  “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for him I’ve had to hide stuff in
  my time... this way,” he added. “I think it’s down here... “ 
  
  They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’ footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats...


.

OK, so if there's a truckload (or train-load, by the description) of stuff in that room, isn't the only reasonable conclusion: ""the room is a fairly popular destination with plenty of people who've found their way there in the past, and therefore, likely, plenty who will in the future""? 

Doesn't matter what your arrogance level is, the evidence seems to point to only one conclusion - it's quite fine as a place to temporarily bury your dirt so teachers won't tag you for your misdeeds, but this is NOT the place to hide something that you want permanently safe! 

So why did Voldemort make such a moronic mistake?
",DVK-on-Ahch-To,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/976,"It is a pebble-on-the-beach approach - how many people are going to find the room, know that there is a diadem in there that is significant (and know what a diadem is, for that matter), be able to find it, and destroy it? Voldemort was relying on the anser being no-one, at least until such a time as he was powerful enough to not be bothered.

And remember that finding the Room of Requirement is not the same as finding the Room of Hidden Things. Finding the RoR is one challenge, but finding as the RoHT - reliably, so that you can come back to it - was a one in a million chance.

And @OghmaOsiris - the fact that three schoolchildren thwarted Voldemort several times is one of the suspensions of disbelief required for the series.

",shannon,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/28251,"That wiring is AC cable, modern AC cable. I can clearly see the bonding strip that makes the sheathing a grounding conductor. So since a grounding means exists you must use it.

With switches, simply screwing them to a grounded metallic box grounds them, as opposed to a receptacle which would need to be a self-grounding type. So technically, just installing the switch would be adequate, but since there is a ground wire from the dimmer I would connect it to the box.

1268,1584,question and answer 2492,Is it ethical to profit by having my students buy my textbook?,"This question was suggested to me by How can I sell my text book to my students in e-book format? which asked about the practicalities, but attracted many comments about the ethics.  So this question is to ask about the ethics directly.

Suppose I have written and published a textbook, and I want to use it as the text for a course I am teaching.  I receive royalties from each copy of my book that is sold, so if my students are required to buy my textbook for the course, I will make some money.  Is it ethical to do so?

Well-reasoned opinions would be useful answers, but even more useful would be pointers to institutional policies, professional codes of ethics, etc, that address this issue.

Of course, there are many ways to avoid profiting from the sale of my book to my students.  If my contract with my publisher allows it, I could distribute PDFs to my students, or have the university bookstore print out copies and sell them at cost.  Another approach I've heard of is to compute how much I earn in royalties on each copy, and refund that amount from my pocket to each student who buys a copy.  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.  Certainly these are nice gestures, but I would like opinions on whether they are ethically required.

Edit: To address some questions that have arisen in the comments:


This question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.
I had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) ""blows"", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  
I don't literally mean that students would be required to buy the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.

",Nate Eldredge,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/1010,"One arrangement with the publisher of my two ""text""-books was that the price be reduced by the amount of the otherwise-royalty for any books sold through the university bookstore, so that, in effect, I was not collecting royalties from students at this university (whether or not I was the instructor).

Under the rules for Short Rest (PHB 186):


  A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the characters maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the characters Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total.


I have a multiclass character - level 1 Monk (d8 Hit Die), levels 2 - 4 Wizard (d6 Hit Die). At the end of a short rest I can spend up to 1d8 and 3d6 Hit Dice to regain hit points.

Can I spend the dice from my pool in any order? Or do I have to spend them in the order that I got my class levels - so always a d8 first, then the d4's?

",quodlibetor,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/8391,"Convenience, mostly: 


I'm now historically using my third AP device - each one has been completely different make and vendor, but as long as the configuration stayed the same (SSID, encryption mode, passphrase), there was no need to re-enter the AP data on any of the client devices. This may not be enough of an issue in a home setting; if you have hundreds of devices which can connect to the network, reconfiguring them when an AP dies would be a royal pain.
Likewise, having multiple identically-configured APs (and thus a larger signal-covered area), the client devices will switch to the AP with the strongest signal without trouble. A few frames may be lost before the new MAC address location propagates through the local network, but overall the roaming is close to seamless.


As for the ""only connect to this AP if it has a specific MAC address"" - this is already possible with NetworkManager on Linux: there is an option to specify the AP's BSSID, which should be the AP's MAC address (of course, the BSSID can be spoofed - hence ""should"").

If you are talking about a sound wave, then whenever one wave has a minimum of pressure, the other has a maximum and vice versa.

  These 27"" and 26"" tires are made to fit older 10 speed/english racer
  type bikes. You should remember that the 26""x1-3/8"" size predates the
  MTB era by at least three decades, they came first. If you have an old
  Raleigh three speed or a 1970s Peugeot then these are the tires you
  need in the appropriate rim size. In general, if you have a Mountain
  bike or your bike is less then 20 years old, these are probably the
  wrong tires for you


According to Sheldon, mountain bikes use ""decimal"" sizes, such as 26x1.75 and some older road bikes from the 70s use ""fractional"" sizes like 26x1-3/4. 

Although it appears you bought 1.375 which is a decimal size, so it should fit modern bikes. However 1.375 = 1-3/8 which is the size the review is talking about. According to Sheldon, 26x1-3/8 would have a BSD of 597mm or 590mm while newer 26 inch bikes have a BSD of 559mm, making the old sized tired too big for modern rims.

1329,1661,question and answer 2627,Why all the dice?,"I'm asking more as an outside observer, and not with anyone who has any grievance with how games are played, nor am I judging or criticizing anything.

I've just always wondered, why use all the different types of dice? Why a 4 sided die for one thing, three 6 sided dice for another, and a twenty sided dice for something else? Couldn't you use, just for example, two 10 sided dice to represent a percentage between 1 and 100 (one die is tens and the other is ones, and they're differentiated by colour), and then use that for all instances?

If you needed to decide something was a one in four possibility, you just declare it a 25% chance, and roll the two tens. No matter what kind of possibility you wanted that are currently represented by various combinations of dice, it seems to me you could represent it within a range of one to one hundred. 

Sure, a bag of all different shaped dice looks kind of cool, but is there a reason for them that goes beyond aesthetics? With just two 10 sided dice (or three if you wanted really fine gradients of percentage) wouldn't that make things simpler and more consistent without losing any of the variety of chances taken?

I thought maybe it had to do with probabilistic outcomes. For instance, if you roll two 6 sided dice, I believe that you're more likely to come up with some combination that adds up to 7 than you are with a combination that adds up to 2 or 12. So there's a bell curve of possible outcomes. Nonetheless, maybe I'm just not well versed enough in probabilities enough to see a difference, but I still think you could get the same equivalent likelihoods of an outcome by using a straight percentage, adjusting up or down depending on what you needed.

Again, I'm not trying to be contrarian, I'm just curious. Is there an objective reason for all the different dice?
",Questioner,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/10772,"Short answer: Yes, your hunch is right: because probability curves, and easy access to them. 

Sure, you could calculate (for example by using AnyDice) in advance the percentage chances of rolling a 2, a 3, a 4 etc on a 3d6, but mapping and rolling everything so would get messy and totally inconvenient practically in an instant. You want predictably varying distribution, bell curves, etc, and all this at your fingertips without having to use a calculator or other app.

Also, dice are nice. It's great to roll them. Look, how they twist and spin and decide your fate. :D

(In getting my software to execute a ritardando, I employed over four measures a measure-by-measure decrease in tempo, and what sounded ""right"" to me ultimately was decreasing the tempo by 4 bpm, then a further 9, then a further 16 (pleasing pattern) to arrive at 127/156 (close to 3/4) the original tempo.)

Not that I'm aware of. Such a rule would be of little value, because -- unless you're practicing with a drum machine, or other device that permits varying tempo -- there's generally no good way (other than feel) to for conductors or performers to accurately measure their tempo during a performance. They're certainly not likely to be thinking ""Now this beat has to be played 10% longer than the previous one, and the following beat has to be 17.4% longer than that...""

However, if I had to guess a general shape of a tempo curve in a ritard, they generally seem to be monotonically decreasing (you don't speed up again in the middle of a ritard), and concave downward (i.e., the most ritard'ing comes just before the end of the ritard). But to what degree this is true is up to the conductor or performers to decide.

On the other hand, about the most prescriptive that I've usually seen music notation get is poco rit. (just a little bit of ritardando), or molto rit. (much ritardando). And of course, the dashed line that Richard mentions, to indicate the duration of the ritard.

That said, I am interested in what the tempo curves of actual performances would look like. I know that approximate tempo maps can be created for real performances, and I'd be surprised if someone, somewhere, hasn't researched what these curves look like.

Is there a particular reason why you want to insert into two tables in one statement?  Perhaps you are looking for both inserts to either succeed or fail as one?  In that case, you would be looking at explicit transactions:

begin tran;
    insert into dbo.YourTable1 ...
    insert into dbo.YourTable2 ...
commit tran;


Besides code brevity and atomicity, I wouldn't see any other reason that you'd want to combine multiple destination tables into a single INSERT statement.

1388,1732,question and answer 2739,Solving a two point boundary problem for a piecewise system of equations,"I'm trying to solve a two point boundary value problem with a piecewise system of equations like:

dx[t_] := Piecewise[{{0, y[t] &lt;= 0}, {x[t]^(3/4) - x[t], y[t] &gt; 0}}]
dy[t_] := Piecewise[{{0, y[t] &lt;= 0}, {(1 - y[t])/x[t]^(1/4) + y[t], y[t] &gt; 0}}]

NDSolve[{x'[t] == dx[t], y'[t] == dy[t], x[0] == 1, y[10] == 2}, {x, y}, {t, 0, 10}]


which produces the error

 NDSolve::bvdisc: NDSolve is not currently able to solve boundary value problems with discrete variables.


I tried the answers here by entering

funs = ParametricNDSolveValue[{x'[t] == dx[t], y'[t] == dy[t], x[0] == 1, y[10] == yt}, {x, y}, {t, 0, end}, yt]

",Mauricio,https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/19635,"There is no need to use Piecewise because both $x(t)$ as well as $y(t)$ remain non negative.
Furthermore, the equation for x is independent of y and can be solved analytically.

The result $x(t)$ is then put into the equation for $y(t)$ which will be solved numerically.

Finally we verify our first statement about the non-negativity.

Ok, here we go.

The eqution for $x(t)$ is

sx = DSolve[x'[t] == x[t]^(3/4) - x[t] &amp;&amp; x[0] == 1, x[t], t]


We can safely ignore the error messages; they are just information which is not relevant here.

(* Out[105] = {{x[t] -&gt; E^-t (-2 + E^(t/4))^4}, {x[t] -&gt; E^-t ((-1 - I) + E^(t/4))^4}, {x[t] -&gt; E^-t ((-1 + I) + E^(t/4))^4}} *)


Taking the real-valued solution

xx[t_] = x[t] /. sx[[1]]

(* Out[106]= E^-t (-2 + E^(t/4))^4 *)

Plot[xx[t], {t, 0, 30}]




Now solving numerically the equation for $y(t)$ using the previously obtained function $xx(t)$:

sy = NDSolve[y'[t] == (1 - y[t])/xx[t]^(1/4) + y[t] &amp;&amp; y[0] == 10, y[t], {t, 0, 50}][[1]]


$\{y[t]\to \text{InterpolatingFunction}[\{\{0.,50.\}\},&lt;&gt;][t]\}$

Works out smoothly, no precision problems.
Here's the function itself

yy[t_] = y[t] /. sy


$\text{InterpolatingFunction}[\{\{0.,50.\}\},&lt;&gt;][t]$

Finally ploting both functions together, magnifying $x(t)$ by a factor of ten for better visibility:

Plot[{10 xx[t], yy[t]}, {t, 0, 30}, PlotRange -&gt; {-1, 20}, PlotLabel -&gt; ""blue x(t), red y(t)""]

First of all, it's probably 4px and not 4. Second, that's just the way the browser vendor decided should be the default.
It is saved in the default browser stylesheets.
You can, but you shouldn't. It differs with each browser. Google it! How do I change default stylesheet on &lt;insert browser here&gt;?
There probably are slight differences, you should be able to tell... by looking at the default stylesheets :)


That difference is one of the main reasons we as designers use a CSS reset, to normalize all of the CSS awkwardness that follows different browser implementations.

1395,1741,question and answer 2752,How can I tell if a downloaded ISO is complete?,"I just ran into a nasty problem with an ISO download from Microsoft.  I successfully burnt it to a rewritable DVD, and copied the contents to the local hard drive on another machine, but when I went to run them they were corrupt.  It turns out the download had been truncated.

Now, OK, sometimes that happens - but it surprised me that the truncated file (which was only slightly more than 60% of the actual ISO) burnt successfully and seemed to be presenting me with a sensible file system, to the extent that I could (apparently) successfully copy the files.

So, is there some way I could have tested the file to see if it was complete or not?  The MS web site did not provide any information about the expected size, so I'm looking for a generic solution: given an ISO file which may or may not be truncated, is there some way to tell?  Do commonly used CD/DVD (data) formats include any embedded information about how much data is supposed to be on the disk, or even better, some kind of CRC?

A solution that detects most truncated images will be accepted, it doesn't need to be perfect.  (I'd prefer something that doesn't give false positives, though.)

[Addendum: a comparison of the disk burnt with the truncated image with the files extracted from the full image suggests that chunks of the data from many of the files were replaced with random information, perhaps from the contents of a previous burn to the same rewritable disk.]

You get the net capacitance as the average of the minimum capacitance (based on the minimum distance b/w the plates) and maximum capcitance (based on the maximum distance b/w the plates) if the plates are flat. If they aren't flat, you need to integrate over the surface of the plates.

  I was wondering about the state of this sql dump if the users are still using the system


pg_dump relies on PostgreSQL's MVCC support to ask PostgreSQL to take a snapshot of the database state at a given point in time.

Changes made by concurrent transactions after the point where pg_dump gets its snapshot do not affect pg_dump, whether they're committed or not.

There are a few things that aren't necessarily consistent, like sequences, which continue to increase while pg_dump is running. But applications have to be prepared for gaps in sequences anyway, so this isn't considered to be a problem.


  Also, I would like to know if pg_dump is the best choice for taking backups in this case

1450,1816,question and answer 2881,Which programs are using my USB flash drive?,"Sometimes when I follow the process to safely remove a USB flash drive, I get told that I can't remove the drive because some programs are using it. However I'm unable to tell which programs these are, so I end up having to close programs - sometimes even randomly. 

How do I find out which program is using my USB flash drive?

I've searched the Internet but have found nothing promising; one solution might be via Process Explorer since it shows handles, but I don't know how to use it to solve my problem.

The best solution would be to have a program that can automatically close these programs for me, or at least tell me which programs these are.

",Michael Kissner,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/3825,"Unfortunately, text replacement in Photoshop is a bit of an all-or-nothing proposition. When it comes to text, PS is a fairly blunt instrument, and lacks the sophistication of a layout program like InDesign. You can preset the basic text styling, but any fine tuning, such as italicizing individual words, is going to have to be done by hand.

I've not tested tabs, but I expect that you can insert an actual tab in a text field in a comma-delimited file and have that honored by Photoshop. There aren't any special codes that would make this work.

That said, what you are trying to do most likely can be accomplished by scripting. There are plenty of helpful folks who hang out on SO and on the Adobe Photoshop scripting forum. In my experience, scripters are terrifically willing to help out when asked.

",Lekensteyn,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/8250,"No, you can't do that directly. In the X architecture, the two physical monitors you see are not discernible by applications. You can only work your way around this abstraction, by determining which areas of the visible workspace correspond to which monitor and then place windows at the correct offset.

Sensible toolkits support a -geometry option, which allows your application to request being placed at a specific position. If you don't have this option available, you can use wmctrl if you have an EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager to move and resize already existing windows (see wmctrl (1), you need options -r and -e). I use devilspie to force placement of some windows and of course your window manager of choice may have its own facility to force window placement.

devilspie allows to apply certain actions on X windows and can use X window properties to discern different windows and applications. The key rule for you would be geometry ""&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;+&lt;xoffset&gt;+&lt;yoffset&gt;"".

Yet, you always need to do the calculations of when and where another physical monitor begins yourself. But this is not too hard and xrandr does tell you how and where it uses monitors in the form of ""&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;+&lt;xoffset&gt;+&lt;yoffset&gt; on each line staring with an output name.

There is not the foolproof-it-will-just-work way, because implementations may (and do!) vary. wmctrl usually works on the window title to identify the target. devilspie can also refer to its class, yet, I am not aware of any toolkit that lets you specify a X windows class but not its geometry.

Of course you could always start two xephyr instances and make one fill your left screen and the other your right screen and then address screens via the DISPLAY environment variable, but this solution has other downsides.

In theory, the authority to govern window placement is the window manager. Consequently, if you want stuff your window manager can't to, it will be hacky and it's also the reason why there is no generic way to accomplish this.

Yet, if your concrete use case is your android emulator ... which is very different from asking for the option to specify SCREEN=n fooapp on the shell, then devilspie may be what you are looking for. Hint: I found it's best to identify applications by their window class.

I have been looking at thermocouples, eg on eBay, e.g. this one. They write some specs but they don't write which multimeter it fits with?

So does any thermocouple fit with any multimeter (or digital thermometer)?
",Mads Skjern,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/35827,"In general any thermocouple can be used with any meter that handles thermocouples as long as they are compatible.  That means that a K type thermocouple must be paired with a meter that is calibrated for K type thermocouples. K type thermocouples are the most common so it is very likely that your meter can handle the one you looked at on Ebay which is a K type. However there are much cheaper K types available than that one which is specified for very high tempertures. As far as calibration goes, there are standard tables of thermocouple voltage versus temperature for each type of thermocouple. This is possible because each type of thermocouple uses the same composition of wires.  Thus your multimeter would have been designed to use the table for K type thermocouples.  The actual accuracy you can achieve is determined by the specified accuracy of the thermocouple and how well the meter conforms to the standard table values which are nonlinear.

It then moves to a women (I think) in the weather service who needs to do something radical (in boats on the sun?) to make it happen. I think there were 3 vignettes but I'm forgetting one of them. The story ends with snow falling on 1 acre and the man gets to see the snow before he dies (which may occur at the end of the snowfall). Does anyone else recall this story and could provide title and author?

Would failed power supply caps cause peripheral damage to the amp, preamp or control circuits ? Supposedly there is ""protection"" for ""DC offset, over current and over heat""

I have a Proton AM-656 amplifier with ""Dynamic Power on Demand"" which is a second higher voltage supply rail (switched to when needed) that creates 6db of headroom and 2 ohm stable. I did not think there was fault protection, turns out the schematic block diagram states there is.

One day with the amp power on I tightened/snugged up the speaker binding post. There was a single frayed speaker wire (unnoticed) that shorted. The amp proceed to billow smoke. I looked inside to find several power supply caps having oozed their electrolyte onto the circuit board. 

I am shopping to recap two of my other amps and was thinking of recapping the Proton, however I do not want to waste my time if there is likely to be damage to the circuits other than electrolytic capacitors.
",erick77,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/50159,"A more likely scenario is that the short circuit damaged the power transistors so they failed short circuit, and they in turn caused the capacitors to fail. If the amp uses discrete power transistors, these will be replaceable. If it's a custom IC or hybrid module, you're less likely to be able to find replacements.

Resistance measurements on the transistor pins (compare with the ""good"" channel) looking for collector-emitter shorts may help confirm this scenario, and show which transistors need replacing. Or if both channels measure the same, you may be lucky and re-capping will be OK.

Both blocks appear to have failed 'simultaneously'

1519,1902,question and answer 3030,Measuring Resistance of a Wire With an ADC,"I'm trying to design a circuit which can measure small resistances down to 0.1 Ohm and a max. of 10 Ohms. I won't be measuring actual resistors but rather large coil of wires, upto 500 m (as you can imagine, these wires are quite thick).

Here's the circuit I came up with:


The circuit works by maintaining a constant current through the device under test, R2. With a current of 100 mA, R2 would develop a voltage between 10 mV to 50 mV.

I think in an ideal world this would work but in practice I may have a hard time measuring 0.1 Ohms with this - mainly due to the ADC. Let's assume the ADC is 10-bit with VREF of 5V. This translates to 5mV per step. If R2 = 0.1 and Iout = 100 mA, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 50 mV - but I'm not sure how buried under noise this would be.

My question is, should I increase the gain to, say, 50. If the gain is 50, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 500 mV - but the max. measurable resistance would be 1 Ohms. To measure 10 Ohms, I would need to lower the current to 10 mA instead of 100 mA. A way to do that would be use an FET to switch out R1 and connect a 20 Ohm resistor at Iout.

I don't need the circuit to measure the resistance precisely - a tolerance of +/- 10% is fine.
",Saad,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/3966,"Please, don't use an LM324 if you want to do precision measurements.  

Your opamp has a gain of 5, but you're not using that: Your output is the inverting input, where you have the same signal as the non-inverting, so that's gain x 1.  

The best choice would be an instrumentation amplifier, where you connect the cable's ends to the two inputs. Use a series resistor to ground to create an offset, because InAmps can't go to the rails (at least the 3-opamp types can't). You can use that resistor as a sense resistor for the current source:  



\$V_{IN}\$ sets the current of the current source: 100 mA/V. Suppose the cable's resistance is 5 &Omega;, then the InAmp will see a 500 mV difference on its input. A gain of 10 (gain resistor isn't shown; CircuitLab doesn't have a symbol for InAmps) will give you 5 V out, or 1 V/&Omega;. By changing \$V_{IN}\$ you can change the total gain. Note that Q1 may need a heatsink, especially if Vcc is rather high.  

 

If you expect high resistances you can make a resistor divider with 1 precision resistor to Vref, and one to ground:



The voltage across the cable will be

\$ V_{CABLE} = \dfrac{R_{CABLE}}{R_{CABLE} + 2 R} V_{REF} \$

but if \$R_{CABLE}\$ &lt;&lt; \$2 R\$ the voltage may be too low for an accurate measurement. A low value for \$R\$ helps, but will draw much current.

The MCP6N11 has Rail-to-Rail output and exists in different types for different gains, among which one for a gain of minimum 100.

edit
markrages comments that we don't need an InAmp, and he's right. Here's the solution with a differential amplifier using an opamp:  



The gain is determined by R1 through R4, and if R1 = R3 and R2 = R4 will be   

\$ G = \dfrac{R2}{R1}\$

An InAmp will give you more precision though, and it won't cost you an arm and a leg, so why not?

1) I'm building a child theme OFF the thematic framework
2) My child theme has a header.php, index.php, functions.php and style.css (at this stage)

&lt;?php
    if( !is_admin() ) {
 add_action('wp_ajax_my_special_action', 'my_action_callback');

  jQuery('#output').html('Got this from the server: ' + response);
 });

});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;


Right so that's all cool - and it updates the OUTPUT div on the page with ""Got this from the server: 0""

I need a PHP function called ""my_action_callback"" - so in my theme's functions.php I have the following:

function my_action_callback() {

 $whatever = $_POST['whatever'];

 $whatever += 10;

    echo 'whatever now equals: ' . $whatever;

 die();
}


This is the ONLY function in my functions.php

To make sure the PHP function is working I stick my_action_callback() into my index.php - and it outputs ""whatever now equals: 10"" as expected.

HOWEVER - the AJAX response is always 'Got this from the server: 0'
Ajax never seems to get the response from the PHP function. 

I tried adding .ajaxError() to see if there were any errors - nope.

I tried adding the PHP functions to another plugin of mine - nope.

What am I missing that jQuery isn't doing the ajax bit for me?

",keranm,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/1107,"Put those add_action functions in your functions.php file too. If they're in header.php, WordPress never registers them since header isn't loaded in AJAX. Also, you don't need that is_admin() check. The theme's header will never load in admin. So, your functions file should look like this:

add_action('wp_ajax_my_special_action', 'my_action_callback');
add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_my_special_action', 'my_action_callback');
function my_action_callback() {

 $whatever = $_POST['whatever'];

 $whatever += 10;

Accessing a global object can include changing things about the object (such as appending a new object to an existing global list). However, if your function tried to do:

def app(mylist):

1547,1935,question and answer 3086,Timing inside a shift register,"How I imagine synchronous digital networks work: data lines are sampled at rising clock edge, a set of transients occur, system settles, and data lines are sampled again on next rising edge. I would place transients at falling clock edges, that way both Tsu and Th time for sampling are clear. (Somewhat similar to SPI bus behavior.)

What see in a datasheet of a real world device (74595): D flipflops connected in series having a common clock. At the output of the first flipflop, transient on the data line follows rising clock edge with Tpd. The next flipflop needs Th time stable data line after rising edge to operate correctly. Of course it works because Tpd>Th, but it's only a matter of nanoseconds.

My problem with all this is that it's not robust (maybe not the best word). Visualizing stuff on a logic analyzer will be less useful because data lines practically change in sync with clock rising edge. Random errors caused by Th>Tpd are not really visible and go undetected. If I connect another shift register in series from a different technology, which requires longer hold times, the circuit won't work, no matter how slow clock I chose.

Is this the way most commonly synchronous digital circuits are constructed? Only the propagation delay of components make it work? Am I being to idealistic? :)

You bring up two issues. Let's call the two synchronous circuits A and B, where A feeds into B, and both share the same clock


Circuit won't work if total Tpd(A) &lt; Th(B) where Tpd is the combinational delay of the clock. Is this true? Absolutely! You're the circuit designer and it's your final responsibility to make sure the circuit works. In reality, it's not usually a source of worry; even if you feed one register output right into another's input, the design margin of the chip's specs is high. For a NXP 74HC595, for example, typical propagation delay at 4.5V supply is 19ns, required hold time is 3nsec, and typical hold time is -2nsec -- no problem there. For a TI SN74LV595A at 5V, typical propagation delay is 4.5nsec, minimum propagation delay is 1nsec, required hold time is 2nsec. Could this be a problem if the propagation delay and hold times are at their worst case? Absolutely. Could it be a problem if you cascade a SN74LV595A into an NXP74HC595? Absolutely. In those cases you may need to add combinational elements (buffers) with enough delay to make sure the hold time is met.
""Visualizing stuff on a logic analyzer will be less useful because data lines practically change in sync with clock rising edge."" True. Take a tip from SPI buses, and set the logic analyzer so that it samples the data on the clock falling edge. SPI's rules are simple: you update outputs on one edge, and you sample inputs on the other.

1555,1945,question and answer 3100,Could fish in plastic bags filled with water float like that?,"I saw this gif earlier and it bothered me how the plastic water bags with fish in it are not submerged in water like they would if we don't do anything special with the water inside and outside the bag:



Then I read the comments on the corresponding Imgur page (I'm not affiliated with the post), asked my friends and figured that this could actually happen in some unusual conditions. I'm not very knowledgeable in physics, but from what I know, the sea water would have to be extremely salty so as to push out the plastic bags. Also the bags themselves must be very tight, so that the plastic material which they are made of contracts to form a spherical shape. Fish may not feel very well, as it might mean increased pressure inside the bag.

The spherical shape of the bags could probably be achieved with just high external pressure, but I'm not sure what could make the bags take a form of a drop. Perhaps if that little bit of air we see was actually so much lighter than the air outside the bags, that it would stretch up the whole bag and even raise its contents above water like that.

Are my guesses correct? What other effects could cause the illustrated state of things?
",user1306322,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/14198,"It looks like a bit of artistic licence was taken (gosh :-) ).  You are correct that, the bags would not float that high up -- at least if I'm correctly viewing them as having only a tiny air pocket at the top.  

The physics is simple: take the total mass of the bag+fish+bagwater, and calculate the equivalent volume of seawater for the same mass.  That's how much volume the bag must displace, so if the bag 'assembly' has low enough density, the remainder of the bag's volume will be above the seawater surface.  It's identical to the way icebergs float.

1560,1952,question and answer 3111,Why would we need to ground an AC source?,"I'm new to this field hence this weird question. Why would we need to ground an AC source? Why wouldn't it be enough to have just one pole to get an AC current going? I understand why it wouldn't work in DC case where current is flowing in one direction. However, in case of AC source where the current is not flowing anywhere but rather just oscillating back and forth it's not that clear to me why connecting load to only one pole wouldn't work?
",RuslanM,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/40908,"Electric circuits are always a complete path, which is the very definition of circuit. In a DC circuit, current flows from one pole to another in a constant, direct manner. In an AC circuit, current also flows from one pole to another, but it changes voltage and direction many times per second. (With mains power, this is 50 or 60 times per second, depending on where you live.)

It's not correct to say that with an AC source ""current is not flowing anywhere but rather just oscillating back and forth."" Current is flowing, but it is changing direction rapidly.

Let's take a moment and do an analogy - mind you, not a great analogy, but one I think that may help. Take a band saw for example. There is a metal blade with teeth that is essentially a ring (a band, which is where the tool gets its name) wrapped around two drums. When you turn on the saw, the blade moves in one direction, and you pass material into the blade to cut. You can think of the band as direct current, always moving in one direction, making a complete circuit.

If you think of a hand saw, where you oscillate the blade back and forth, the analogy falls apart, because there is not a complete circuit. In order for electric current to flow, there must be a complete circuit. It may be that this sort of idea is what has confused you with regard to alternating current. Because it is possible to move a saw blade by only acting on it from one side, you might assume a similar effect could be achieved with electric current.

Instead, imagine that the blade must always be continuous, thus we're back to the band saw. This time, let's say the tool moves the blade up and down (like a jig saw) and the teeth on the blade are modified to cut in both directions. You can still pass material into the blade to cut, but you're always cutting with the same section of blade, assuming that the movement in each direction is the same. Each time the blade moves up, it has to stop and reverse direction. The same is true with the downward cut. Think of these momentary stops as the point at which the AC voltage source is at 0 volts (the zero crossing).

Unlike a battery, an AC voltage source is always changing the voltage potential of the two poles, in an equal and opposite manner. When one pole is at a positive voltage, the other pole (with respect to the first) is at a negative voltage. As the voltage of one pole changes, the other is mirroring it. Current flows from one to the other, always.

Now about that ground thing... When you consider an AC source and a load, you basically have two connections. One pole to one side of a load, and the other pole to the other side of the load. Neither pole is really ground, because they're both just opposite sides of the AC source. You can call one of them ground, but realize that doing so is just a reference. If you decide that pole ""B"" is ""ground"" then you're essentially saying all voltage measurements should be with respect to that pole. If you were to measure any part of the circuit with a voltmeter, you would connect the black probe to the wire you've labeled as ""ground"" and all readings would be based on that as a reference.

In most household electrical circuits and appliances, ground is actually a third wire. The two poles I mentioned earlier are called ""hot"" and ""neutral"" (black and white wires in the US), and ""ground"" is the bare copper wire (or often green). The purpose for this ground is safety. A simple appliance might have a metal enclosure, which is connected to ground. Hot and neutral enter the appliance to power it. If something were to go wrong, like a wire came loose inside, if the chassis were not grounded, touching it could result in an electric shock. Having the chassis grounded instead diverts current back to Earth ground, usually in a very abrupt manner, such that the circuit breaker trips and power is cut off.

Mind you, this is a simplified explanation, but I hope it helps you understand the basic concept of AC and to differentiate between what constitutes the wires of the circuit and ground both as a concept and a physical connection.

A key point is to avoid storing both the hospital ID and name in the Health_Professionals table.  Store only the ID.  When you need to see the name, use the hospital ID to join with the Hospitals table and get the name from there.

A useful side effect of this design is that if anyone ever misspells a hospital name, eg ""Hosptial"", you need correct that error in only one place.  Same holds true whenever a hospital is intentionally renamed.

I'm using wordpress with woocommerce, and I would like to automate the following step. When an order is completed, I would like to change the user role associated with that order id from 'customer' to 'subscriber'.



By searching around, I think I should be able to accomplish this by using a hook in functions.php:

add_action( 'woocommerce_order_status_completed', 'change_role_from_customer_to_subscriber' );


Then add the function:

function change_role_from_customer_to_subscriber($order_id){
// code to change role to subscriber
}


In the code, I think I need to do 2 things:
1) get the user id that is associated with that order id
2) change role of that user id to subscriber



I've tried a lot, but I couldn't get it to work (neither getting the right user id, nor changing the role of a user id). So any help would be appreciated! I've seen 2 related questions asked before on stack overflow, but unfortunately the answers there did not work for me. I hope someone can help me out!

Thanks a lot! :)

Any ideas?
",Rostam,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/41126,"Looking through the code there is a very relevant example:

        $old_spent = absint( get_user_meta( $order-&gt;user_id, '_money_spent', true ) );
        update_user_meta( $order-&gt;user_id, '_money_spent', $old_spent + $order-&gt;order_total );

        $old_count = absint( get_user_meta( $order-&gt;user_id, '_order_count', true ) );
        update_user_meta( $order-&gt;user_id, '_order_count', $old_count + 1 );
    }
}
add_action( 'woocommerce_order_status_completed', 'woocommerce_paying_customer' );


which reminds us that the $order_is passed to the woocommerce_order_status_completed hook. From the $order_id, you can create a new order object, with the user_id as a property.

Armed with that knowledge, I think we can just fix the inner guts of the function get a new user object from that user ID, and remove the old role and finally apply the new role.

function wpa_120656_convert_paying_customer( $order_id ) {

    $order = new WC_Order( $order_id );

1599,1998,question and answer 3191,Change of basis in non-linear Schrodinger equation,"At the mean-field level, the dynamics of a polariton condensate can be described by a type of nonlinear Schrodinger equation (Gross-Pitaevskii-type), for a classical (complex-number) wavefunction $\psi_{LP}$. Its form in momentum space reads:

\begin{multline}
i \frac{d}{dt}\psi_{LP}(k) =\left[\epsilon(k) 
-i\frac{\gamma(k)}{2}\right] \psi_{LP}(k) 
+F_{p}(k)\,\, e^{-i\omega_{p}t}  \\
+  \sum_{q_1,q_2} g_{k,q_1,q_2}\, \psi^{\star}_{LP}(q_1+q_2-k)
\, \psi_{LP}(q_1)\, \psi_{LP}(q_2).
\end{multline}

The function $\epsilon(k)$ is the dispersion of the particles (polaritons). The polaritons are a non-equilibrium system, due to their finite lifetime (damping rate $\gamma$). Therefore, they need continuous pumping with amplitude $F_p$ at energy $\omega_p$.
Finally, there exists a momentum-dependent nonlinear interaction $g_{k,q_1,q_2}$ that depends of the so-called Hopfield coefficients $X$ (simple functions of momentum) as:

\begin{equation}
g_{k,q_1,q_2}=g\, X^{\star}(k)\, X^{\star}(q_1+q_2-k)\, X(q_1)\, X(q_2)
\end{equation}

How can one transform the equation for $\psi$ to real-space?
",Andrei,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/24609,"Here is my attempt at an answer, following the suggestion of @Lagerbaer. We first subtitute the Fourier Transform for $\psi_{LP}(k)$,

\begin{equation}
\psi_{LP}(k)=\int dxe^{-ikx}\psi_{LP}(x),
\end{equation}

and get

\begin{multline}
\int dxe^{-ikx}i\frac{d}{dt}\psi_{LP}(x)=\int dx\left[\epsilon(k)-i\frac{\gamma(k)}{2}\right]e^{-ikx}\psi_{LP}(x)\\+F_{p}(k)\,\, e^{-i\omega_{p}t}
+\int dx_{3}dx_{1}dx_{2}\\ \times \sum_{q_{1},q_{2}}g_{k,q_{1},q_{2}}\, e^{i(q_{1}+q_{2}-k)x_{3}}\psi_{LP}^{\star}(x_{3})\, e^{-iq_{1}x_{1}}\psi_{LP}(x_{1})\, e^{-iq_{2}x_{2}}\psi_{LP}(x_{2}).
\end{multline}

In order to simplify this expression, we need to apply the inverse transform to both sides (multiply by $\int dke^{ikx}$), obtaining

\begin{multline}
i\frac{d}{dt}\psi_{LP}(x)=\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dk\left[\epsilon(k)-i\frac{\gamma(k)}{2}\right]e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}+F_{p}e^{i(k_{p}x-\omega_{p}t)}\\
+\int dke^{ikx}\int dx_{3}dx_{1}dx_{2}\\
\times\sum_{q_{1},q_{2}}g_{k,q_{1},q_{2}}\, e^{i(q_{1}+q_{2}-k)x_{3}}\psi_{LP}^{\star}(x_{3})\, e^{-iq_{1}x_{1}}\psi_{LP}(x_{1})\, e^{-iq_{2}x_{2}}\psi_{LP}(x_{2}).
\end{multline}

Now we look at an integral of the form $\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dkf(k)e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}$, for a generic function $f(k)$. We expand our generic function in a Taylor Series around $k=0$, and get:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dkk^{n}e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\left(-i\right)^{n}\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\partial_{x}^{n}\delta(x-x^{\prime})
\end{equation}

where we have used the well-known relation $\int dkk{}^{n}e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}=\left(-i\right)^{n}\partial_{x}^{n}\delta(x-x^{\prime})$.

Moving the derivative operator to act on $\psi$ (integration by parts), we finally obtain

\begin{equation}
\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dkf(k)e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}(i\partial_{x})^{n}\psi_{LP}(x)=f(i\partial_{x})\psi_{LP}(x)
\end{equation}

Therefore, the first term on the RHS of our equation simplifies to $\left[\epsilon(i\partial_{x})-i\frac{\gamma(i\partial_{x})}{2}\right]\psi_{LP}(x)$ and we are left dealing with the interaction term.

\begin{equation}
\int dx_{3}\psi_{LP}^{\star}(x_{3})\int dx_{1}\psi_{LP}(x_{1})\int dq_{1}e^{iq_{1}(x_{3}-x_{1})}\int dx_{2}\psi_{LP}(x_{2})\int dq_{2}e^{iq_{2}(x_{3}-x_{2})}\int dkg(k,q_{1},q_{2})e^{ik(x-x_{3})}
\end{equation}

Substituting the form of $g(k,q_{1},q_{2})$, we get

\begin{equation}
g\int dx_{3}\psi_{LP}^{\star}(x_{3})\int dx_{1}\psi_{LP}(x_{1})\int dq_{1}X(q_{1})e^{iq_{1}(x_{3}-x_{1})}\int dx_{2}\psi_{LP}(x_{2})\int dq_{2}X(q_{2})e^{iq_{2}(x_{3}-x_{2})}\int dk\, X^{\star}(k)\, X^{\star}(q_{1}+q_{2}-k)\, e^{ik(x-x_{3})}
\end{equation}

Does anyone know of a quick way of finding this (if there is even one)? Can I somehow use the relation that:

$$\langle r\rangle ~=~ \frac{a_0}{2}(3n^2 - \ell(\ell+1)),$$ 

or do I just have to brute force and use properties of Laguerre polynomials and spherical harmonics and what not?
",Vallin,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/15814,"You're confusing the expectation values of the vector $\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z)$ and its magnitude $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$. Because the hydrogen hamiltonian is parity invariant, all its eigenfunctions are chosen to have a definite parity. This means that the expectation value $\langle\mathbf{r}\rangle$ will always be zero because each component is the integral of an odd function times an even probability distribution function.

The second expectation value you mention,
$$\langle n,l,m|r|n,l,m\rangle=\int \mathrm{d}x \mathrm{d}y \mathrm{d}z \psi_{n,l,m}^\ast(x,y,z)\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}\psi_{n,l,m}(x,y,z),$$
is quite different, since you're not counting the direction of the distances you add. This is the same as comparing the averages of $x$ and $|x|$ over some 1D probability distribution function $p(x)$. The average of $x$ will be zero if $p(x)$ is even, while the average of $|x|$ will only vanish is $p$ is a delta function, concentrated at the origin. Thus $\langle|x|\rangle$ can be quite large while $\langle x\rangle$ is zero because of cancellations.



This is not to say that expectation values of $\mathbf{r}$ are not interesting, but one must simply be more careful. The fact that the diagonal matrix elements vanish says that the eigenstates have no permanent dipole moment - which of course they can't as they are eigenstates of an isotropic system. What doesn't vanish, however, are the transition matrix elements,
$$\langle n',l',m'|\mathbf{r}|n,l,m\rangle,$$
which play an important role in the hydrogen atom's interaction with radiation. (Specifically, they control the leading-order interaction energy, which is the dipole coupling $-q\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{E}$.) Because the components of $\mathbf{r}$ are themselves spherical harmonics of degree 1 (or linear combinations of them), the matrix element above will involve the spherical integral
$$\int\mathrm{d}\Omega \, Y_{l'm'}^\ast Y_{1,\mu} Y_{lm}$$
for $\mu=-1,0,1$. 

Because the spherical harmonics have a rich orthogonality structure, only a few of these integrals will survive. Specifically, you need $\Delta l=|l-l'|=1$ and $m'=m+\mu$, which has the physical content of the dipole selection rules: for a dipole coupling to radiation, only S-P, P-D, D-F, ... transitions are allowed. Further, only a few spatial orientations are allowed: $m$ can increase or decrease by one (which happens if $|\mu|=1$, and corresponds to circularly polarized light in either direction, with the electric field rotating in the $x,y$ plane) or stay the same (when $m=0$ and the light is linearly polarized along $z$).

1617,2023,question and answer 3226,"Learning the musical concepts in the book ""Gödel, Escher, Bach""","I am reading the book ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"", in which the author tries to present concepts in mathematics, drawings and music as instances of a certain ""pattern"", that he calls ""strange loops"". He makes several comments about Bach's music, in particular, as the title suggests. So, he talks about the fugues, sonatas and partitas, modulation, themes played against themselves, how Bach manages to get two or more musical lines going simultaneously and so on.

But I don't understand a thing about these musical concepts. I have tried to listen on YouTube to some of the compositions he mentions in the book, but my stupid brain only hears a stream of notes flowing. I can't recognize the patterns he talks about, nor can I grasp, for example, the fact the the ""Canon per Tonos"" rises successively until it reaches the key C again. 

So how can I learn more about these musical concepts, so as to better follow the book's main ideas? To make this question narrower, I'm not asking for general references to learn about music, but something very specific to the content of the book, so that I don't miss important information (and fun) from his exposition.
",Otavio Macedo,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/12666,"A key to following the polyphonic music of Bach is to be able to single out the individual voices. You will be very much helped by having a score at hand. In a fugue, the theme is presented in one voice, then repeated on the dominant with slightly modified intervals (but same rhythm and pitch profile) in another voice, then introduced in the tonic in a third voice and so on. A good pianist will bring out these entries, but seeing them in the score will most likely aid your understanding of what goes on.

Keeping track of modulations throughout a piece can be quite challenging even for experienced musicians, but in the score these different tonal regions can be easily identified.

By the way, I think the ideas about self reference and Gödel's incompleteness theorem are much harder to grasp for most readers of GEB, but still the book is just as enjoyable.

1649,2061,question and answer 3284,Is Stormguard Warrior really that good?,"I have an idea of build centered around the Crusader class, with some possible dips in Warblade/Swordsage to take advantage of the goodies in other disciplines (such as Ironheart Surge or Time Stands Still).

The dip in the Warblade class brings me the opportunity to take the Stormguard Warrior tactical feat, and I have seen it recommended a number of times specifically for its Channel the Storm option (ToB, p.36):


  Channel the Storm: To use this option, you must choose to refrain from making one or more available attacks of opportunity against a single opponent. On your next turn, you gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for each attack that you refrained from making against the same opponent. You gain this bonus only against an opponent that you refrained from making an attack of opportunity against in the previous round.


I am wondering if this feat is really that good. It seems that it requires a huge investment (in terms of feats) and it is unclear to me whether it really pays off.

The bonuses +4 AR/dmg per refrained AoO (which you have an infinite supply of (*)) do seem interesting, at first, however:


A prerequisite of Stormguard Warrior is Ironheart Aura, which in itself does not seem that interesting, especially for a Crusader (Thicket of Blade is not an Ironheart stance)
The bonuses gained can only be used against the opponent that generated them, and no other (it's a minor restriction, but worth keeping in mind)
An AoO is likely to do much more damage than 4, especially if using a two-handed weapon (even at level 1, we are looking at 1d10 + 6 ~= 11.5)


Thus, the two feats investment seems only worth it if one can generate more AoOs than one has available. In the recommendations I have seen, it is combined with Robilar's Gambit (-4 AR, 1 AoO per foe attack in melee) which itself requires Combat Reflexes. Dexterity is unlikely to be ignored (since it benefits Touch AC), and therefore we are looking at a minimum of 3 or 4 available AoOs per round...

Letting Combat Reflexes and Robilar's Gambit aside, is it really worth it investing in Ironheart Aura and Stormguard Warrior? Am I missing something?

(*) I have seen some debates where it is argued that refraining to take an AoO to fuel up Channel the Storm should use it up, which I ignore here. The feat is much worse in this case.
",Matthieu M.,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/1355,"Stormguard Warrior is an excellent feat – for building a character around

Stormguard Warrior can add huge amounts of attack and damage bonuses, but it requires that you be pretty dedicated towards generating attacks of opportunity to not take. Specifically, the feats Karmic StrikeCWar and Robilar’s GambitPHB2 are often used, because these feats allow you to take many more attacks of opportunity than you could otherwise (Karmic Strike allows you an AoO every time you’re hit, while Robilar’s Gambit allows you an AoO every time you’re attacked, whether they hit or not). Other ways of getting attacks of opportunity (defensive rebuke Devoted Spirit boostToB) or prevents others from avoiding them (thicket of blades stanceToB as mentioned, Mage Slayer featCArc) are also useful, but don’t add nearly as much as Karmic and/or Robilar’s.

But Ironheart Aura is pretty much a dead feat, yes, and without Karmic or Robilar’s, you’ll rarely see more than +4/+4 from Stormguard Warrior. +4/+4 for two feats isn’t entirely awful, of course; the Weapon Focus/Specialization line (which are awful) is four feats for +2/+4. If you have reach and thicket of blades, the +4/+4 seems pretty likely; using defensive rebuke can improve that dramatically. And it is pretty much expected that you’re using Power Attack with a big two-hander, so it’s really +0/+12. Basically, you’re trading extra attacks (attacks of opportunity) for more potent attacks in general (skip one AoO, get a full attack with +12 on each attack). So it’s not a terrible use of feats. Just not the highly-recommended one that it would be with Karmic and/or Robilar’s.

Also, note the Combat Rhythm option on Stormguard Warrior; it’s not nearly as explosive as Channel the Storm, but it is cool. Personally, I have always wanted to have that opportunity to combine it with avalanche of blades for hilarity. That’s not really an option for a crusader with a warblade dip, though.

The other thing to point out about Stormguard Warrior is that the Evasive Reflexes featToB uses the same “don’t take an AoO you could have, get something instead” mechanic, and like Stormguard Warrior, it doesn’t use up the AoO. You can use both Evasive Reflexes and Stormguard Warrior. This is particularly useful when you have thicket of blades – their 5-ft. steps provoke an AoO from you, which lets you 5-ft. step to keep up with them and gives you +4/+4. If that step was to try to get away from you so they could do something that provokes (say, cast a spell while you have Mage Slayer, or attack an ally after you hit them with defensive rebuke), you have either just prevented them from doing that, or are going to get pumped up even more.

In the second problem, you understand $$\tan A={10\over AC}$$ You want to isolate $AC$. This can be done by multiplying both sides by $AC$, getting $$(AC)(\tan A)=10$$ and then dividing both sides by $\tan A$ to get $$AC={10\over\tan A}$$

They are attacking the village because they are evil, they are stealing the princess because they are evil, etc.

Over time, my group needs have grown to need more complicated and detailed villains. It is important to consider motives.  What is it that defines them as 'evil' to the party?  In terms of a fantasy setting, what would you consider to be an interesting villain?

What qualities make a villain that inspires your party to rally against him?  What kind of villains have worked for your games in the past?

Example:


  A member of nobility is using trade connections to move valuable pieces of art into another country that is secretly paying him quite well and is framing a member of the party to take the fall.  In addition, someone important to the party member has been taken hostage with a promise of release once they party member takes the blame for the crime.

It comes about from the following progression:

Further constraints:

$y(0)\approx 1.27$ is an otherwise-unknown constant that I am attempting to build an expression for.

The initial problem is the recurrence relation with $a_1\approx 1.27$ the unknown constant and

  Clicked links turn purple because blue + ""read"" equals purple


Is there any specific reason why a link is blue and when it is clicked/read, it turns to purple?

Do these colors have any meaning?
",Shevliaskovic,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/41986,"There can of course be more than one reason in favour of a decision, whether conscious or unconscious, yet more against bad alternatives (so they get rejected before we even see them) and hence I reckon the other answers here are also partially true. Indeed, quite likely so, since there's an answer here that talks about TimBL while I'm going to talk about Mosaic, which was independent from him.

One stated reason for Mosaic choosing the colour, is that 4-bit colour was still common, and so designs would need to consider how well they would look on such displays. Most such displays used two sets of colours, one of which was of the sequence:

0) Black 1) Blue 2) Red 3) Magenta 4) Green 5) cyan 6) yellow 7) white

(Note the fun way the mixing of colours and adding of numbers has the same results).

Then there would be another set of the same colours, but lighter (sometimes ""light black"" would mean grey, sometimes ""dark white"" would mean grey, sometimes both).

Of this sequence, the colours were darkest to lightest in that order (still true of the equivalents in sRGB, NTSC and other richer colour-spaces, though the exact proportions are generally different). Indeed the scheme was designed so you could depend on different relative shades when used with a monochrome display (black and white, black and green or black and orange).

Hence the darkest colour other than black (already used for normal text) that therefore offered the next-greatest contrast against a white or (as used by said Mosaic browser) grey background, was blue. Hence what would later (when attributes for describing colours where added to HTML) be called #0000FF was the standard link colour. (#000080 would also have been available, but not as distinguished from the black of unlinked text).

Red is well-known as a means of emphasis, it would be an appropriate choice for an active link (and was used as such, though I'm pretty sure not until later on, with Netscape Navigator 2.0 if memory serves, since before &lt;frame&gt; and javascript an active link didn't mean much as the page was going to unload anyway), but inadvisable for a visited link, which if anything should be de-emphasised compared to unvisited. After red, the next brightest colour, and so the next most appropriate for text other than blue and black was magenta, but the darker #800080 (purple) was sufficiently different to both blue and black to be distinguished from them, and again the darker choice and hence that which stood out best against a light background.

Question: I now have a requirement to deliver text messages with high certainty, but also to give feedback about a wrong phone number if that is possible. Should I have something like my mail queue to send text messages to my user phones or not?

I think it makes sense if we're talking about marketing messages, but what about text messages sent to users to verify their phone numbers?

What if their phone number is typed incorrectly? The phone API will tell me right away but if I put the request in the queue, I won't be able to let them know about it.

Rephrasing of the question: Should I care about the immediate feedback and loose the ability to deliver all SMS messages in case of temporary failure?
",Fabio Milheiro,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/1493,"Depending on the API for sending text messages, there are two possibilities for meeting those business requirements.


If there are separate API calls to verify a phone number and to send a text message, you can use a queue for the actual sending and verify the validity of the phone number just before you put the text message in the queue.
If there is only an API call to send a text message, which informs you about success/failure after the fact and where the failure codes are descriptive enough, you could send the message initially from the context of the user request. If that fails with a temporary error, add the message to a queue for later retries.

1763,2207,question and answer 3515,Is decoherence even possible in anti de Sitter space?,"Is decoherence even possible in anti de Sitter space? The spatial conformal boundary acts as a repulsive wall, thus turning anti de Sitter space into an eternally closed quantum system. Superpositions remain superpositions and can never decohere. A closed system eventually thermalizes and undergoes Poincare recurrences. Whatever the dual is to an interacting conformal field theory, is it really a theory of quantum gravity, or does it only look like one superficially?
",theorist,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/6788,"Your question is not about AdS at all, it is about a closed quantum system with a finite number of degrees of freedom.

If you examine the space-time near a finite area quantum black hole, you will see an approximate AdS space. For this reason, my original answer included AdS spaces in the list of finite systems, although this is completely false for what people would call a normal classical AdS space. Thse spaces are unbounded and make open systems. The near horizon extremal black hole is presumably sitting in an infinite spacetime, so it is also an open quantum system. So it is best to reformulate the question for the domain you intended:

How can you have irreversible decoherence in a closed quantum system with a finite number of degrees of freedom?

The same question can be formulated to a certain extent in a closed classical system, where Poincare recurrences still occur. How can you reconcile poincare recurrence with irreversible information gain by an observer?

I think the many-worlds point of view is most useful for understanding this. If you have a closed quantum system that contains an observer, it is the observer's gain in information that determines which relative branch of the wavefunction becomes the real one for this observer, a branch selection from the decohered branches which occurs outside the theory. The branches are still effectively dechered so long as the arrow of time is still forward, because the wavefunction is spreading out into new regions of the enormous phase space. It is reasonable to think that the system will need to thermalize and destroy all the observers long before the recurrence makes the entropy decrease to the initial value.

This observer can only exist while there is an arrow of time, so there is no real paradox. You can have effective decoherence and measurements for the thermodynamic arrow-of-time stage. The same is true in classical closed system, the observer will have to dissociate and reform in order for the system to have a poincare recurrence.

But perhaps you meant this as a counterexample to the claim that irreversible decoherence can occur in pure closed-system quantum mechanics. In this case, I agree that it is obvious that the closed system cannot really decohere irreversibly, since it will eventually recohere to close to its initial state.

",MapMan,https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/4750,"Halil,

The interface you are using to create the buffers IFeatureCursorBuffer2 creates buffers for selected features.  Your point that you create based upon the users button click is not a feature but a graphic which you are adding to the graphics container of the map. A Feature is essentially a row in a table or featureclass.

As you are adding your point as a graphic I assume the buffer you want to create will also end up as a graphic. Use the interface ITopologicalOperator and it's method Buffer to create a polygon then do as you did with your point, create a graphic element.

1770,2215,question and answer 3529,Would a meta-answer be a good idea?,"One of the stated goals of the site was the have one comprehensive answer to each question. I think we can definitively say that it hasn't worked out that way. I think the reason is reputation. If one person answer the question with 40% of the information that a comprehensive answer would contain, and another with another 40% with 20% scattered among three other answers. Who's answer will get edited with the combined information and get the further upvotes? It just doesn't happen. People don't want to edit questions and mess with someone else's reputation (quite rightly, IMO - how would you feel getting a downvote for something added to your answer that you didn't write?).

One idea to get towards that goal would be to have a community answer on each question, with say a small reputation bump (2 points?) for participating in making it. To prevent reputation inflation, you can only get the 2 points from a given question one time, with a daily limit (say 10 points) for doing it on questions asked by others.

Then when the question is seen for posterity, it will be the first answer.

The issue is what to do with the accepted answer? One possibility is to only open the community answer once there is an accepted answer and pre-fill it with that answer.

Does any of this make sense to anyone else?
",Yishai,https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/130225,"I think this would be useful in the case of questions such as those discussed in What&#39;s the rationale behind closing a useful question with 70K views?, where a question has been locked and/or closed because there are a huge number of answers.  In many such cases, there are numerous duplicates or near-duplicates lurking in the undulating moebius strip of answer pages simply because people have eagerly added their contribution without taking the time to scan the 72 pre-existing answers to see if theirs is already there.

So allowing moderators to establish a single 'meta-answer' for such question would provide a way to merge duplicate and similar answers into one comprehensive (and comprehensible) whole.  The meta-answer would be ""sticky"", i.e. be presented first.  It might be necessary to only show it to those with a certain privilege level, or to visibly indicate it as a draft (or both) until such time as it's considered representative of the general body of answers to the question.

One problem I can see with this idea is that it would potentially involve a lot of tedious editing work.  The amount of work needed could be reduced / made remotely practical by providing a way to mark answers as having been incorporated into the meta-answer; such a flag would presumably be disabled or visibly expired if a compiled answer was edited.

I can't really think of anything that compilers could stand to gain from such work, since it would certainly have to be considered a CW-type undertaking.  Maybe a ""maintainer"" or ""compiler"" badge for people who do a lot of such edits?

Also, how can I put some space between the text and the checkbox?

Thanks.
",omega,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1497454,"Try using setCompoundDrawablePadding(int) (or android:drawablePadding in XML) to set some space between the text and checkbox.  

Regarding getting the selector working, &lt;CheckedTextView&gt; extends TextView, so try setting
android:clickable=""true"".  

Obviously, if you're using the CheckedTextView in a ListView, make sure your ChoiceMode isn't set to CHOICE_MODE_NONE.

It's about a chrome extension I'm trying to write for my audio stream. Here's what I'm trying to do:

A small icon, that when is clicked once starts playing music, and when is clicked again stops, and so on...

Here's what I've tried:

&lt;!doctype html&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script src=""popup.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div id=""music""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


and popup.js

var well=0
//Executed when the extension's icon is clicked
chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function(tab) 
{ 
    if(well&gt;0)
    {
        var well=0;
        document.getElementById('music').innerHTML= '&lt;iframe src=""#"" width=""100"" height=""100""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;';
    }
    else
    {
        var well=1;
        document.getElementById('music').innerHTML= '&lt;iframe src=""http://electro.piratefm.ro/popup.html"" width=""100"" height=""100""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;';
    }
});


What's happening is that when the extension is loaded, no music plays. When you click it, it starts playing and everything's fine. When you click it again, it stops for a couple of seconds then starts playing again. I need it to stop until you click it again.

Thanks for reading and sorry if it's already been asked or if it's dull.

use the property that v1.v2=0 , if v1,v2 are perpendicular.

OK.so, let A(2,-6,1); B(3,4,-2); C(7,-1,5) be given.
Now lets  find BC vector, which comes BC(4,-5,7).
Now suppose a point P(x,y,z) in between B and C.and draw perpendicular from A to this point P .
We can find AP vector which is AP(x-2,4+6,z-1).
now dot product of AP and BC is zero. From here you get P.Once you have P. The |AP| is the required distance

Can such a thing be done?  I have a vague idea that I might make a text file with a list of the new names and call that list @newnames.  I would make another array out of the current file names, and call it @oldnames.  I'd then do some kind of for loop where each element $i in @oldnames is replaced by the corresponding $i in @newnames.

I don't know how to make an array out of my current file names, though, and so I'm not sure if this vague idea is on the right track.  I keep my files with the messed-up names in a directory called 'oldnames'. The below is my attempt to make an array out of the file names in that directory:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict; use warnings;

my $dir = 'oldnames';
opendir ('oldnames', $dir) or die ""cannot open dir $dir: $!"";
my @file = readdir 'oldnames';
closedir 'oldnames';

print ""@file\n"";


The above didn't seem to do anything. I'm lost. Help?
",user2585169,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2585169,"Your code is a little odd, but it should work.  Are you running it in the directory ""oldnames"" or in the directory above it?  You should be in the directory above it.  A more standard way of writing it would be like this:

use strict; use warnings;

my $dir = 'oldnames';
opendir ( my $oldnames, $dir) or die ""cannot open dir $dir: $!"";
my @file = readdir $oldnames;
closedir $oldnames;

This would populate @files with all the files in oldnames, including '.' and '..'.  You might need to filter those out depending on how you do your renaming.

1846,2306,question and answer 3677,How do you decide when a paladin has fallen from grace in DnD 5e?,"There does not seem to be a clear-cut way to determine when a paladin's actions have become egregious enough to justify them breaking their oath. Do a lot of minor slights eventually add up and cause an oath to be broken? Do they get some sort of warning like losing their laying on of hands ability? 
",adclark09,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/22899,"You're right.  There is no clear cut way.  That's by design.  How this works varies a lot by playstyle:

Some groups have a solid understanding of ethics and jurisprudence and use some limited form of said understanding adjudicate alignment in D&amp;D.  Others use their full understanding of ethics, which cumulates for them into a D&amp;D compatible system, to perform that adjudication.  These groups are very similar except that the first group tends to have less issues adjudicating alignment in difficult situations where the latter group discovers holes in their beliefs about morality.  In both of these cases alignment is adjudicated according to the chosen moral/ethical system, and what constitutes oath-breaking will be adjudicated similarly according to the related principles of jurisprudence. As moral relativism becomes, unfortunately, increasingly popular, objective alignment becomes less and less so, especially amongst simulationist groups, and so these two methods of alignment adjudication are unlikely.

Some groups think alignment is stupid, meaningless, and entirely subjective.  These people are very vocal.  They likely also think that oathbreaking is similarly problematic.  Like alignment-based powers in previous editions, in these groups if you're going to use anything that's based off alignment or alignment-like systems (like the paladin class) you should first check with your DM to find out 1) if it's allowed and 2) what it means in the context of the campaign.  One common solution in the past in these kinds of groups has been just to waive the alignment restriction entirely, for the Paladin class.

Some groups think that obviously alignment is objective, because it's in the rules, but they just don't understand it yet.  These groups will post difficult alignment questions as they come up on online fora.  The outcome of alignment based actions in such groups will be fickle and likely a point of tension.

Some groups try and adjudicate this according to the original inspiration for the alignment system, which is a set of novels written by Michael Moorcock.  This is hard because the novels are novel-y and don't explain exactly what Law and Chaos are in cut and dry terms.  Such groups would probably not adjudicate the oath the same way they do alignment, because Jurisprudence is fundamentally a principle of Balance, not Law, in that system, and there's almost nothing to go on for how something like the 5e paladin oath should be dealt with.

In any case, if you are not the DM, ask your DM how the metaphysics of ethics and jurisprudence are related in their game.  If they are related, seek to focus more on the adjudication of ethics than jurisprudence as the ethical component is probably dominant in most GM adjudications.  If they are not related, ask about Jurisprudence in general, and the adjudication of your class abilities in particular, if necessary, focusing on what an Oath means, what it means to break it, and how reparations might be made if the oath is indeed broken.

If you are the DM, I strongly recommend you consciously decide what philosophical system of justice you will use in your campaign, as all of the other options amount to unconsciously using some system and putting some introspective thought into this choice before you start running the game is likely to make these kinds of decisions much easier and much faster during the game sessions, since you will spend much less time figuring out how to approach each specific case.

If you want a place to start looking at different approaches to the philosophy of oaths, I recommend this paper.

I  connected the netbook to an external monitor (through VGA) and the display in the external monitor shows up just fine. I have been able to use the netbook without any issues with an external monitor.    
Aside from the monitor, the netbook still works (I can shut it down with keyboard shortcuts) and the files that it has shared through LAN can be accessed fine. The torrent client's web interface on the netbook can also still be accessed on another computer.  
The issue sometimes happens even at BIOS startup.  
The variations of the distortion will sometimes change randomly.   
Occasionally, the non-distorted screen display will simply freeze.
The netbook didn't fall in the ground or get hit by an object.  
The netbook is mostly used as a torrent seeder and downloader. Its lid is opened and closed around 2 times a day only, but the netbook is powered on almost 24/7 (its lid is closed most of the time). It is mostly accessed through another computer through LAN and is not often used directly.  
The netbook was bought around 2 years ago.

1867,2332,question and answer 3716,The Probability of Catching Criminals,"I have been struggling with the following question and would greatly appreciate any help  :)


  Suppose we have information about the supermarket purchases of 100 million people. Each person goes to the supermarket 100 times in a year and buys 10 of the 1000 items that the supermarket sells. We believe that a pair of criminals will buy exactly the same set of 10 items at some time during the year. If we search for pairs of people who have bought the same set of items, would we expect that any such people found were truly criminals? Assume our hypothesis to be that a pair of criminals will surely buy a set of 10 items in common at some time during the year. 


This is meant to be an illustration of Bonferroni's principle. Suppose there are no criminals and that everyone behaves at random. Would we find any pairs of people who appear to be criminals?

We must initially find the expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year. I'm not sure whether I do this correctly...

Here is how I've been going about solving it:

Number of possible pairs of people: $\binom{10^6}{2} = \frac{10^{12}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{11}$, using the fact that $\binom{n}{2} \approx \frac{n^2}{2}$, when $n$ is large.

Number of possible 10-item selections: $\binom{10^3}{10} \approx 2.6 \times 10^{23}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at a point in time:
$\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at least once over the course of 100 periods in time: $\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a pair buying exactly the same 10 items (both at least once) over the course of 100 periods in time: $(\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}})^2 = (\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{21}})^2 = \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}}$

The expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year is thus:

$ 5 \times 10^{11} \times \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}} = \frac{5}{6.75 \times 10^{31}}$

Because the above number is so low if we do find a pair buying the same 10 items then, under our hypothesis, they are likely to be criminals and not a false positive case. 

I am just wondering whether my solution to the above is correct?
",user1200428,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/72187,"If a person $A$ buys some (any) $10$ of the $1000$ items, then the probability that some other person $B$ buys the same set of $10$ items is 
$$\frac{1}{\binom{1000}{10}}.$$

For $N = 10^6$ people, and over $T = 100$ time units, the number of pairs of people is $T \binom{N}{2} = 100 \binom{10^6}{2}$.

So the expected number of occurrences of a pair of people buying the same set of items at the same time is

In a such way, when the current passes trough windings the rotating magnetic field is formed, which is the sum of all three vectors. This is the principle of induction motor that Nikola Tesla made 130 yrs ago.

If you simply swap two wires, the magnetic fieled changes the direction of rotation.

One of the cells of such table is intended to show a very long list of items from where I want the user to select one.

One of the options I think there are, is to show letters of alphabet as indexes at the right side of a plain table. Since my first table is a grouped one, my navigation hierarchy would be then like this:

  

Would it be inconsistent to navigate from a grouped table to a plain table? If so, could somebody give an existing example? I didn't find anything related to this in iOS Human Interface Guidelines, maybe it is described somewhere else and this navigation pattern breaks the guidelines.

Another option could be having a search bar. Can a search bar be used in both a plain table and a grouped table? The existing example of such bar I found is in Contacts app and it is a plain table. In a plain table, could both an alphabet index and a search bar be shown?

1877,2344,question and answer 3735,Ad layout for programs - Illustrator or InDesign,"today I'm looking for some advice from folks who have laid out event programs. 

In this case, the client (a local nonprofit) has a famous keynote speaker at their event, and have solicited donations from local businesses. Each donation over a certain level = a full page ad in the program for the event. Most of them are ""Congratulations to  on your anniversary"", etc. with a company logo sitting somewhere (the businesses that send in their own camera-ready artwork will just have them dropped into place). 

I'm going to be laying each ad out in a template so they look consistent; my question to the GD crowd is, ""Should I lay the template out in Illustrator and bring each ad individually in to InDesign or should I create a template page for an ad in InDesign and lay each ad out in InDesign?""

Based on your experience, what are the pros and cons of each approach? Obviously it would be easier to lay each ad out in Illustrator (that's what it's there for) but I lose a certain amount of flexibility once I hit InDesign (the program will ultimately be laid out in InDesign).

If the ads are more illustrative in nature, I'd use Illustrator for the ad, then place then in a master Indesign document. Ads with text transforms, image interactions (cutouts) or with other non-critical design elements such as spot illustrations or flourishes can often be easier to create in Illustrator.

If the ads are more text-based, I'd use Indesign for the ads as well as a master document.

How do these papers get accepted in journals / conferences? Do people have to submit their source code privately to the reviewers at least, so that they can reproduce the experiment if possible.

Do most journals / conferences just ""trust"" that people who submit the paper really implemented the theory and got those exact results?

I always had this idea that any experiment should be reproducible by others else it's not scientific justified. Been wondering about this the last few days.
",Sam Stoelinga,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/17302,"This is a view from Computer Science/Theoretical Computer Science/Mathematics.

Ask yourself: who is the target audience of an academic paper? 

It is not end-users. It is reviewers! 
Do reviewers want code? Depends on the situation. Sometimes they do. Often they don't.

Think about this: why mathematicians don't provide formal proofs but use informal arguments? 

It is costs vs. benefits. Providing a formally verified proof is possible but usually needs too much work, work that authors are not trained for and don't have much experience with. On the other hand, what do authors gain from it? Does it help convince the reviewers about the correctness of the results? No, usually reviewers prefer short informal explanation that allows them to understand and see why the result is true. A formal proof usually will not help much. There are people who don't like computer-assisted proofs which cannot be verified and understood directly by humans.

The same costs vs. benefits thinking applies to programs. If providing code will not help convince the reviewer about the correctness of the paper, then why waste resources (time/money/pages/...) to do so? Do reviewers have time to read codes with thousands of lines to check there is no bug in them? 

On the other hand, sometimes the software resulting from the paper is of primary interest. Having the code is helpful in verifying the claims. E.g. you claim you have a faster algorithm for SAT. Then it is helpful to provide the code. In such cases authors provide their code. This is mainly in more experimental parts. We don't care about the correctness of the code but obtaining results better than existing algorithms. In such situations there are typically standard benchmarks to compare algorithms. (See for example SAT competitions.) If there aren't established benchmarks then why publish code? If it is a theoretical result where the asymptotic benefits take place over instances which are too large to test what is the benefit of have the code? More so considering the fact that large code developed by non-professional programmers is highly likely to be buggy? Employing professional software developers to develop quality code is costly (the median annual income for a person with a bachelors in CS is around 100K in the US) (except possibly as graduate students ;) and doesn't typically have any profits afterwards.

But does code need to be included in papers? Of course not! There are better ways to publish code, e.g. having a link in the paper to an online copy (on their website or a public repository like github). Why would one prefer to include a code with thousands of lines inside a document which is supposed to be read by humans?

1956,2443,question and answer 3900,Do delegates defy OOP,"I'm trying to understand OOP so I can write better OOP code and one thing which keeps coming up is this concept of a delegate (using .NET). I could have an object, which is totally self contained (encapsulated); it knows nothing of the outside world... but then I attach a delegate to it. 

In my head, this is still quite well separated as the delegate only knows what to reference, but this by itself means it has to know about something else outside it's world! That a method exists within another class!

Have I got myself it total muddle here, or is this a grey area, or is this actually down to interpretation (and if so, sorry as that will be off topic I'm sure). My question is, do delegates defy/muddy the OOP pattern?
",Dave,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/72130,"If OOP means each object is responsible for its own interface, then logically delegates could break OOP if it were not used properly.   For example, if I made a FileStream class which, when asked to write, called a delegate to perform the write on behalf of the FileStream class, then it would breach OOP.  This is because the responsibility of the write operation of the FileStream is purely upon FileStream if we're following OOP to the letter.

However, this doesn't mean that using delegates always goes against OOP.  Using the same example, if I used a delegate to handle events before and after writes, this is still following OOP because it is not the responsibility of FileStream to know what should happen before and after writes.  It should merely notify the classes which are responsible.  

If passing delegates to an object were breaching OOP because it knows something outside its world, then also passing variables would breach OOP since you could think of delegates as passing code rather than data to classes.  Acknowledging that there exists code outside of a single OOP class is not breaching anything.

  unfriendly: ""Look, we're not mind readers here. What do you mean it's not working?""
  
  neutral: ""What did you expect to see, and what did you see instead?""
  
  friendly: ""Sorry to hear that... I hope we can help you! But we need a bit more information. What did you expect to see, and what did you see instead?""


I think one thing that's being missed here is the sheer scale of Stack Overflow. Civility is always required when commenting, but big cities are less overtly friendly than small towns because there are certain realities about the scale of the population and amounts of time available. Would you rather write one baroque, florid ultra-friendly comment to a single user, or three civil-but-direct comments to three different users? Which choice best achieves the goals of Stack Exchange?

I can't recommend frequently adding a bunch of noisy, unnecessary, non-content ""friendly"" words to a comment, words that everyone on the Internet has to read through and parse before getting to the actual information in the comment. This isn't what Stack Exchange is about.*

Therefore, favor the short neutral comment response. Never be rude, but get to the point quickly and efficiently so we can help as many people as possible get answers to their questions. That's what we are here to do.

* Now, if we could pare it down to one additional word instead of the seventeen in the above example, perhaps that'd work.

You can continue to nest folders but any single folder should not have more than 5,000 direct children (items or folders).

That being said... you will find there are limitations putting more than 5,000 documents into a single library no matter how efficient your foldering structure. This is because certain operations will apply to all items below a certain level and those operations (if they affect more than 5,000 items) will be throttled.

In my experience this includes:


Adding a indexed property to the library that contains more than 5,000
Changing permissions on t he library and or folder that contains more than 5,000

When you invoke sp_send_dbmail that is exactly what is happening.


  I want to setup an EVENT NOTIFICATION for SQL Server, and I'd like to
  send e-mails to operators for each message on the queue


Then do just that. Create an activated stored procedure on the queue of your service that receives the notifications and have it RECEIVE the message and invokes sp_send_dbmail. 

I think you are trying to 'cut out the middleman' and have the EVENT NOTIFICATION send the notification directly to the DB Mail queue. That is not possible because the code that handles the messages arriving in the DB Mail queue expects the messages to have a certain format (ie. the one created by sp_send_dbmail). The messages sent by Event Notifications would have a completely different format and the DB Mail processor would choke as it does not understand them. In order to prevent exactly such situation Service Broker services are bound to specific contracts and DB Mail service does not accept the http://schemas.microsoft.com/SQL/Notifications/PostEventNotification contract used by Event Notifications.

In the year 1855, German inventor Heinrich Geissler developed mercury pump which is later modified by Sir William Crookes who became the first to produce cathode rays.



Figure 1: Geissler's Vaccum tubes(1862)

Since, then vacuum tubes are being used to study cathode rays, Braun's tube was actually an improvement to the these.

Otherwise, all of them have used some kind of Vacuum tube which produces cathode rays.


  
  In 1858 Julius Plücker showed that cathode rays bend under the influence of a magnet.
  In 1865 H. Sprengel improves the Geissler vacuum pump.
  In 1869 J.W. Hittorf establishes that ""rays"" from the cathode travel in straight lines.
  In 1871 C.F. Varley is first to publish suggestion that cathode rays are composed of particles.[Fig 2]
  In 1874 George Johnstone Stoney estimates the charge of the then unknown electron.
  In 1876 Eugen Goldstein introduces the term cathode ray to describe the light emitted.
  In 1881 Herman Ludwig von Helmholtz suggested the idea that there is a smallest unit of electricity.
  In 1890 Arthur Schuster calculates the ratio of charge to mass of the particles making up cathode rays (today known as electrons) by
  measuring the magnetic deflection of cathode rays.
  In 1894 J.J. Thomson announces that he has found that the velocity of cathode rays is much lower than that of light.

  The logic through which controller class definitions are loaded builds the path to the file above the explicit include paths on which the autoloader relies. This means no local vs. core precedence.

2037,2544,question and answer 4050,glsl demo suggestions?,"In a lot of places I interviewed recently, I have been asked many a times if I have worked with shaders. Even though, I have read and understand the pipeline, the answer to that question has been no.

So, I decided to take the plunge and wrote some simple shader in GLSL(with opengl).I now have a basic setup where I can use vbos with glsl shaders.

I printed out the cards in sheets of nine cards (onto standard A4 paper), then chopped them out with scissors. This might take a while if you've got too many, but 80 should be OK.

To make them more sturdy, I bought 100 penny-sleeves and got a bunch of old, unwanted Magic cards (try your FLGS or CCG-playing friends if you have none). I simply placed the printed cards (on paper) into a sleeve with a Magic card to make it firm and less vulnerable to breaking while shuffling/dealing/etc.

If the card-backs are significant (they weren't for me), you could print them out too and place them in the other side of the sleeve, but honestly that sounds like a lot of work. For instance, if there are two types of card, you could put some Magic cards in backwards, or use different CCGs, or different colours of Magic card.

Anyway, I used Illustrator to create lots of images (with transparent backgrounds) of different letters, each one filled with circles. More to the point, upon exporting as a .PNG, I noticed a resolution option. Me being the little derp that I am, I figured a larger resolution is always better, so I set this to high (300 ppi).

Upon importing the images into my project however, I realized that the images had become a lot larger than they should be. Upon tweaking the export resolution setting, I noticed that if I set this to low (72 ppi), the images come out as the expected size. I was just wondering how I should expect this to effect my drawings. If I were to keep the high resolution images I exported at 300 ppi, am I always going to be forced to reduce their size afterwards by a certain amount? Otherwise, should I always stick to  72 ppi in order to keep the size of the image the same and to avoid needing to re-size things later?

Image quality is not so important in this case, so there probably isn't much reason for me to use anything higher than 72 ppi anyway. Just for the sake of learning however, I thought this would be a good question to ask.

2055,2567,question and answer 4087,How to 'select' menu items that also link to deeper items?,"Currently I'm working on a navigation that doesn't take up too much screen real-estate. I came up with a pseudo off-canvas navigation with stacked menus.

A user can assign nodes to a product. This is the current state of the wireframe; user chose Add nodes. Now he want's to manually search for a specific node 1 (1. Browse Nodes in wireframe). The user now can select a node to add to product 2 or go 1 level deeper into the navigation 3. and 4.. If you click on a node-link the children off that node will slide-in and stack on top of the current menu. There is also a back option to parent (second wireframe).

I deliberately chose checkboxes, links and button as elements because that's their purpose; I wireframed there functionality not a design-solution. Normally I like selecting text/label also checks a checkbox, but now the label is a link too. A user could a) select that node to add to product, Or b) select node to navigate to children of that node.





I could argue if it makes sense that a node will act is a leaf and a branch. A don't have any real data about how customers assign nodes. I can't wait for this input. Currently functionality of the system is that a node could be a leaf and a branch. So asking real users is no option. Maybe in the future (months from now).

How to convert this into an intuitive navigation?
",myradon,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/41645,"Here are some suggestions:

The title/heading of the first menu layer, 'Search Nodes', is confusing. It might be better just to echo the link the user just clicked to slide out the menu i.e. ""Add Nodes"" 

It feels like you might be over-using checkboxes. The first example of this is next to 'Select previously bookmarked nodes'. A checkbox shouldn't be necessary if there's only one option, and even so, you complicate the interaction here. A checkbox should require one click to select, and another to confirm the choice, whereas a more appropriate element, like a button or a simple link, would only require one. 

Regarding your key question, again, I think your choice of repeating checkboxes and buttons will result in complicated interactions and cluttered UI. 

Here's an alternative solution for your consideration:



(1) An accordion-style menu, with disclosure triangles to reveal deeper options.

(2) Hovering over elements that can interacted with reveals a text link and action. In this case a branch node has already been added (hence the green color and checkmark) so the option is to Remove.

(3) This node has already been added.

(4) Hovering over this leaf node reveals the option to Add.

Of course there are are lots of stylistic variations to this, but it doesn't require multiple slide out menu trays, both leaf and branch nodes can be added/removed, and it doesn't require the repetition of check boxes and buttons.

Right now tweet keywords are done using the ILIKE query.

This works pretty well if the keyword i'm looking for is a commonly used word, like 'love' , 'friend', 'OMG', etc. but less common words like ""geospatial"" need to search through a lot more data in order to find the last n instances of the word. This is dead slow.

To combat my slowness I'm building a GIN index on my tweet field in postgres. Two days later and i'm still waiting for the index to complete. Once it's built though, I'll try a few queries using SQL view parameters and hopefully this will dramatically speed things up.

Even if this approach works though, it's not going to be all that useful if the index takes so long to create -- the maintenance of it will not be able to keep up will the incoming flood of data.

  Each compactification leads to a different vacuum state.... at least one state should describe our Universe in its entirety.... the enormous number (~10^500 at last count) of solutions, with no perturbative mechanism to select mechanism to select among them, leads some critics to question the predictive power of the theory..Even more worrying is that, while the theory is perturbatively finite order by order, the perturbation series does not seem to converge.


I don't know anything about string theory and so I could not make head or tails this. All I know is that ~$10^{500}$    is a very large number. 


What exactly is a 'solution' in string theory? Is it a spacetime metric of some sort or the terms of a S-matrix of some sort?  
Why are there so many 'solutions'? 
I thought string theory was supposed to be finite, why do perturbative series still diverge?
Is there any experimental technique to limit the number of 'solutions'?

",dj_mummy,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/28244,"Who wrote that passage? It contains some misunderstandings.


  All I know is that $10^{500}$ is a very large number. 


It is a finite number. How many theories do you know which have a finite number of solutions? Have you tried to count the number of solutions of plain Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dirac-Higgs theory without its string-theoretic UV completion? There are not only infinitely-many solutions, there is a hugely infinite-dimensional space of solutions. This is the usual state of affairs for most every theory of physics ever considered. String theory is special in that it puts many more constraints on the solutions, such as to even leave just a finite number (under some assumptions).


  What exactly is a 'solution' in string theory? 


A background for perturbative string theory is a choice of 2-dimensional superconformal QFT of central charge -15. This can be interpreted as describing an effective target space geometry which is a solution to a higher dimensional supergravity theory with higher curvature corrections. A ""solution"" to string theory is a solution of the equations of motion of that. At least without non-perturbative effects taken into account. 

See on the nLab: landscape of string theory vacua for more.


  I thought string theory was supposed to be finite, why do perturbative series still diverge?


String theory is thought to be loop-wise finite, thus being a renormalized perturbative theory. No sensible remormalized perturbative QFT can have converging perturbation series. The perturbation series must be an asymptotic series to be realistic, and it comes out exactly like this in string perturbation theory. 

See at the String Theory FAQ on the nLab the item Isn’t it fatal that the string perturbation series does not converge?


  Is there any experimental technique to limit the number of 'solutions'? Will experimental techniques be able to pinpoint a solution within present day string theorists' lifetimes too?


Models that have been and are being built in string phenomenology approximate the standard model to more detail than probably most people are aware the standard model even has. Check out some of the references there. Given the slow but continuous flow of new articles on these matter, one sees that some people are slowly but surely working on improving ever further.

2075,2595,question and answer 4127,House rules to make the cloister less of a game winning tile in Carcassonne?,"In my experience, cloister tiles in Carcassonne are often ""too lucky"". If you draw a cloister tile in the beginning of the game, it will typically still require an investment of quite a bit of ""meeple"" time to obtain the full 9 points, which makes it a fair trade-off. However, after about half of the game, it's relatively likely that you can ""parachute"" a cloister tile in some spot and get 8 or 9 points immediately. This adds a lot of randomness to the game.

What house rules work well to diminish this effect?
",Erik P.,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/30,"I don't have bad experiences with cloisters. But if they count too heavy, you can rule that an unfinished cloister counts as 0 points in the end. Which makes it harder to spend too much meeple on them.

Another possible rule is that cloisters must have unique 9 squares, not shared with another cloister.

But use them wise.

2076,2597,question and answer 4131,"Buck converter with op-amp, inductor issues when load changes","I'm looking at the designs for a simple buck converter which has the P mosfet, inductor, capacitor and reverse based diode. Instead of PWM, I'm trying out to use an op-amp to switch the P mosfet but one thing that I notice is that if the load changes from low resistance to high resistance then the inductor spikes the voltage on the load to double what it is until it can re-stablise. (This is all in simulation)

Is this happening because I'm using the op-amp? How does using PWM affect the inductor in such a way that if the load would change from say 10 ohms to 100 ohms that the inductor won't spike the voltage? Perhaps PWM / fast switching keeps the inductor with such a low charge that when the load changes, the inductor doesn't have nearly enough voltage to do anything?

Cheers.
",2tails,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/29571,"For any given load, a switcher will transfer a given amount of energy thousands of times per second. This is how the buck regulator works.

Let's say your op-amp is switching at 10kHz (because it's a slow sort of device and will have slew rate problems compared to other devices). Let's also say you are aiming to deliver 5V across a 10 ohm resistor. Resistor power is 25/10 watts = 2.5 watts. 

To calculate energy per switching cycle divide this power by frequency because power = joules per second. At 10kHz, the energy you transfer per switch cycle is 250\$\mu J\$. 

This energy powers your load resistor but, if you removed your load resistor, this energy gets dumped into the output capacitor and its voltage rises a little (or a lot) higher than normal.

Let's say your output capacitor is 10uF - if suddenly it was imbibed with 250\$\mu J\$, how much would it rise in voltage?

We know that capacitor energy is \$\dfrac{C V^2}{2}\$ therefore we can calculate the voltage rise and this is: - 

\$\sqrt{\dfrac{250\times 10^{-6} \times 2}{10\times 10^{-6}}}\$ = 7.07V.

It's a little bit subtler than this - in the above I assumed the capacitor was being charged with energy from a zero voltage state. In fact it already has 5V across it and this means that the previously stored energy + influx energy (from the inductor) is 125\$\mu J\$ + 250\$\mu J\$ = 375\$\mu J\$. 

If you do the reverse math, the peak voltage on the capacitor becomes 8.66V i.e. 3.66 volts higher than the 5V rail. 

You could put an argument together to consider the losses in the diode also - this may trim half a volt of the absolute peak voltage.

So, you either need to increase the capacitance a lot or, decrease the transfer energy by increasing the operating frequency. Modern switchers regularly operate at 500kHz and this means the energy per cycle reduces from 250\$\mu J\$ to 5\$\mu J\$ in this example.

Should this be the case (500kHz operation), the rogue energy from the inductor would make the capacitor's stored energy 130\$\mu J\$ and this means a peak voltage of 5.1 volts - probably quite acceptable for load dumping on a switcher.

Operating at higher frequencies requires faster silicon but, the ability to control load variations (and their repercussions), on a cyclic basis, means much tighter control of the output voltage.

This is just an example to see where you might be going wrong.

It is also called an emitter follower because the emitter voltage always ""follows"" the voltage of the base minus the base-emitter diode voltage drop (about 0.6v).

This mode is not convenient when you try to switch a load that uses a voltage higher than the voltage you connect to the base, so if you try to drive a 12v relay connected to the emitter with a microcontroller that feeds the base of the transistor with 3.3v or 5v then you will see that the relay actually gets 2.7v or 4.4v (for 3.3v and 5v input) which is much lower than needed.

On the other hand it can be very useful if you want to make a regulator, you can use a zener to drive the base with a constant voltage and the emitter output will keep a constant voltage approximately 0.6v lower than the base.

",Konny,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/16916,"When you use a PRF to derive a key, there is the potential for collisions. If you derived a 128-bit key from each possible 128-bit number, you'd expect some of them to collide. Specifically, you'd expect only about 63%  of all the inputs ($1-e^{-1}$) to appear as outputs.

That means you lose less than a bit of entropy even if the original key had the full 128 bits of entropy, like your random 128-bit string. With a lower entropy key you'd lose less. That doesn't matter in practice, since in the worst case it wouldn't even halve attack time. 127-bit security is enough.

In general, if you use a PRF to derive an $n$-bit key from one with $k$ bits of entropy, the resulting key will have at least $\min(n, k) - 1$ bits of entropy, approaching $\min(n, k)$ when $k \ll n$ or $k \gg n$.

2133,2682,question and answer 4276,Can a malfunctioning relay in an amp cause or allow a speaker to crackle when turning the vol potentiometer?,"Ok, so this question has several layers, I admit it.

I recently acquired a Lepai 2020A+ amp. It is, I believe, the latest version PCB because it has the two relays for speaker protection instead of just the one.

I'm new to electronics, so please excuse my total lack of knowledge.

What I understand is that the function of these relays is to delay the power output to the speakers when the device is turned on; to avoid any pop that may damage the former. It may also work when turning off the device, to avoid a thump... but of this I'm not sure. It's a cheap amp with cheap components.

Anyway, I received it and I noticed the left channel had a slight crackle when I turned the vol pot. It started right when I brought it out of 0 percent. But then it started crackling at around 20, then 50. I assumed it was rust or just the protective film flaking off of the cheap pot. So I sprayed it with some contact cleaner. After much caring for it, I've been able to reduce the crackling back to the original crackling I heard when I first turned the pot. If the amp has been off several hours, then it will slightly crackle when turning the pot up from 0. If I turn the pot a couple of times before turning on the device, then there's no audible issue.

All the time, this is only happening on the left channel. The right one is 100 percent clean. Other than this, the amp works as expected.

However, the other day the amp was off and I turned the pot and heard a slight crackle. I did notice, when I first received the amp through the mail, that if turned off and disconnected, the circuit still retains some power: first thing I did; right out of the box, I switched it on without connecting it and that intensely unnerving blue light the Lepai has around the vol control came on and fade off for a couple of seconds.

So I'm still trying to make sense of this issue. Trying to know if it's a faulty, old pot that's seeing its last days on the left channel and, therefore, I should just invest in a better pot and change it (because the rest of the amp modestly rocks) or if it's more complicated than that... perhaps an issue with the left channel relay, etc., and I'd better change the device entirely.

I probably am shooting way off the mark here but the first thing I thought when I heard that crackle when the amp was off was that perhaps the speaker-protection relay for the left channel is not working. But does a relay like this only work during on and off? Or does it still work throughout the process? And, if so, does it have the ability to ""filter"" these noises?

I'm thinking that even if some ""filter"" component (not necessarily the relay; if any of you knows the Lepai maybe you know if it has any filter incorporated) is not working like it should, that horrible noise must be coming from the vol pot. Am I wrong to think that? And to think that if the right channel is completely clean, then it must be an issue with the side of the pot that outputs to the left channel?

And finally, could this noise be digital and coming from deeper in the circuitry or does it necessarily have to be analog and coming from the pot?

I know this is a layered question but I've been looking for individual answers all over the net and can't find any, so I'm hoping somebody out there can help me out by guiding me into electronics though this, my first mod project.

Thanks a lot in advance!
",QuestionerNo27,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/76714,"In addition to a possibly dud pot, it can be caused by DC applied across the pot, possibly from a leaky coupling capacitor. Measure the DC voltage across each channel of the pot - you may find the noisy channel has some DC while the other channel has much less or none.

DC in the presence of slight variations in the track resistance will generate intermittent AC signals as you adjust the volume, which sound like crackles or thumps.

",Kenny Wyland,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/6973,"Yes - it's OK to mix. The more RAM you have, the more files can be cached over time and the more processes can sit resident in RAM for faster switching between tasks running at the same time.

(even the initial intel GMA integrated MacBooks where having non matched RAM where there were only two slots did noticeably slow the graphics performance). The iMacs of the past several years all need high quality ram that matches their specifications fairly exactly - but run well with whatever lineup of good ram is installed.

If it makes a difference, the tech note and consumer installation guide will tell you in which order to install RAM and will call out when matching pairs will make sense due to the architecture of that machine. Again, more ram is always faster.

Also - when you are buying a new mac - often the seller will credit the value of the pre-installed RAM as new memory if you want to buy up to have larger chips (2x4GB) and then you can add the second later as needed.

  strength: this is the first commandment. And the second is like,
  namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none

From here we can see that there are two great commandments namely: loving God and loving thy neighbour.


  Romans 13:9-10 (KJV) For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt
  not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
  Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is
  briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy

Then according to Paul, loving thy neighbour is obeying the 5 half of the 10 commandments. If so, then when Jesus said to love God in 4 parts with all you heart, soul, mind and strength, what He really meant is obeying the first 4 of the 10 commandments.

2156,2713,question and answer 4326,Is there a way to fill your tires with nitrogen?,"I know this is a rather controversial issue. I was skeptical as well before doing this on my car, and I have not refilled my car tires for several months. Before that I needed to adjust the pressure every couple of months at least. 

Now I think it is a good idea to try this for our bikes. Especially since, when I see I need to fill up my bike tires, I get too lazy and give up the ride altogether. 

Is there a way to do this at home?

EDIT:
I thought I'd update the question for people who come and read later:  

Thanks for all the comments, I drive a lot (30kmiles/year) and I saw (to my surprise) a significant difference with nitrogen. 

I understand the reasoning with losing oxygen over time and increasing the N2 concentration but in practice that does not happen fast enough.  

I think I'll look into Helium/Argon and I'll update you if I managed to do something interesting. 

And I live in a small place I don't like to have a large pump but that is exactly why pumping is such a chore for me,

2166,2725,question and answer 4342,What's the base f-stop when counting an ideal f-stop for lens?,"I've read a lot around this site that an ideal quality of the lens is achieved when using f-stop roughly 2 stops slower than the fastest value of the lens.

Firstly, I'm not exactly sure what ""2 stops"" mean when it comes to f-stop, but this isn't really important in what I'm about to ask. What I'd like to know is what is the base f-stop when counting this value.

Let's look at it this way: If I have a prime lens with f/1.8, then obviously I'll be getting the ideal value from f/1.8, let's say after 2 stops I get f/2.8?

But! What in case of zoom lenses, for example 18-55, which have f-stop f/3.5 - f/5.6. Should I take f/5.6 as my base value, or does the base value depends on the real fastest value at the exact focal length?

Therefore, if I set the lens to 18 mm, their fastest aperture is f/3.5 and thus the ideal quality is at f/5.6 and when I set it to 55 mm, their fastest aperture is f/5.6 and thus the ideal quality is at f/8 ? Or is it f/8 for the whole focal range ?
",Richard Rodriguez,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/4822,"Real fastest value at the exact focal length.

But, this is just a rule of thumb — it's not necessarily exactly two stops in every case.

For the question of what two stops mean, see What does f-stop mean?. In short, each stop is approximately the-square-root-of-two times the previous one. That means half the light is allowed in (which is why the seemingly-weird series of numbers was chosen). Two stops is doing that twice, which conveniently works out to simply being doubling. Two stops from f/2 is f/4, and and two stops from that is f/8. Or, starting at f/1.8, two stops is f/3.6.

The test results comparison tool used by Digital Photography Review is interesting for looking at this. Try this test of Pentax's 18-55mm zoom, which like most kit zooms goes from f/3.5 at the short end to f/5.6 zoomed out.

You can see that at 18mm, the sharpness improves as you go from f/3.5 to f/4 to f/5.6. At f/8, it's more even from center to corners, but doesn't get any sharper. And beyond that, it drops off.

Then, change the focal length to 55mm. You'll notice that with this lens, overall sharpness goes down from 18mm at f/5.6. At f/8, it picks up a little bit, and a little more at f/11, and then back down again at f/16.

So, that fits with the two-stops guideline pretty well. Same for the Canon kit lens, and Nikon too.

With the Pentax DA 15mm f/4 Limited test, they've got test results in third-stops, and there you can see that f/7.1 is no better than f/6.3, and f/8 is worse — so that's only 1⅓ stops. On the other hand the DA★ 55mm f/1.4 shows peak sharpness at f/4.5 — closed down by 3⅓ stops. This doesn't reflect a problem with the lens, just different priorities in design. The Nikon 50mm f/1.4G is similar, with peak sharpness at 3⅔ or 4 stops down. However, the entry level Nikkor f/1.8G fits the ""two stops"" guide quite well, peaking at around f/3.5.

It's also worth noting that this test is primarily concerned with sharpness, because that's easy to measure. Other image quality and rendering characteristics are also affected. Vignetting (light falloff in the corners) gets better the more you stop down, and it's usually gone after two stops. And bokeh quality is usually improved by stopping down, too — generally, lens bokeh is nicer/smoother stopped down a bit, but of course it's less visible since you have greater depth of field. Plus, shape of the aperture blades will become visible in specular highlights, which is a side-effect unrelated to stopping down per se — some modern lenses have rounded aperture blades to make that not be a concern.

  The default glob expansion puts the pages in alphabetical order.


The index page links to nine different documents, whose names aren't in alphabetical order.

You need to list the files on the command line in the order you want htmldoc to process them.

In this specific case you can produce an ordered list of filenames as they're linked in the index with:

awk '/http:|\.\./ {next}; /&lt;a href.*\.html/ { gsub(/.*href=""/, """") ; gsub("".html.*"", "".html"") ; print }' index.html | uniq


so

htmldoc --webpage -f gdb.pdf index.html $(awk '/http:|\.\./ {next}; /&lt;a href.*\.html/ { gsub(/.*href=""/, """") ; gsub("".html.*"", "".html"") ; print }' index.html | uniq)

PhD admissions committees at strong departments are looking for clear evidence of potential for high-quality independent research.

Test scores only matter if they're low.  In particular, if your math score is low, there will be serious doubts about your math ability, and if your verbal/TOEFL score is low, there will be serious questions about your communication skills.  In some departments (like mine in CS), admission to the PhD requires a TOEFL Speak score above a certain minimum (in my case: 22), because all PhD students are expected to be TAs at least once while they're in the program, and the state of Illinois requires a minimum Speak score (in my case: 24) on TAs who are not native English speakers.

Publication records only matter if the papers are either good or horrible.  It's utterly impossible to tell from the number of publications whether the applicant has significant promise for future independent research.

2221,2799,question and answer 4460,Best CMS for review-type sites,"Is there an ideal CMS for making a review site? By review site, I mean like a restaurant review site where you have each entry belonging to different major categories like Cuisine and City. Then users can browse and filter by each or by combination (Chinese Food in Los Angeles, with suggestions of other Chinese restaurants in LA, etc). Furthermore, I'd want it to support other fields like price, parking, kid-friendliness, etc. And to have users be able to filter by those criteria.

I've been told that with a combination of custom taxonomies, plug-ins and many clever little queries, that Wordpress 3.x can handle this. But I'm having a heck of a time with it getting into the nitty gritty, and that's where I find the community support is lacking. The sort of stuff you'd think would work in WP, like making one parent category for Cuisine and one for City, don't really work once you get further in and start trying to pull it all together. Then you find these blog posts where people say, ""This example shows that one could create a huge movie review site using custom taxonomies..."" but when you go and try it you hit all sorts of challenges and oddities that point a big long finger at Wordpress being in fact a blogging platform. The best I came up with was one category for the cuisine and one tag for the city, then I created a couple of custom tag-like taxonomies for the other features. It's quite a mess to try to figure out how to assemble all of that into a natural, intuitive site. I expect a few versions down the road WP will be able to do these sorts of sites out of the box.

So I thought I'd take a step back before I run back into the Wordpress fray and find out if maybe there is another platform better suited to this sort of relational content site. Directory scripts in some ways offer many of the features I'm looking for, but I need something more flexible and, hopefully, interactive (comments, reviews). I'm especially looking for feedback from people who've crafted sites like this. Thanks!

It allows you to easily animate assembly instructions by simply moving the objects.
Logically, it makes more sense: the pieces are physically separate; in the real world, they are separate objects, so they should be in Blender as well.

2228,2811,question and answer 4476,Does the function which sends a right angled triangle to its area produce infinitely many numbers having hardly any prime factors?,"Let $T$ be the set of pythagorean triples, that is, triples of integers (a,b,c) satisfying a2 + b2 = c2. We think of $T$ as the set of right angles triangles with integer lengths. And let $f : T \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ be the function $(a,b,c) \mapsto \frac{ab}{12}$ which computes the area of a triangle (divided by 6, which seems to always be a factor for some reason). 

I was wondering: what are the number theoretic propertires of $f$? It seems to produce numbers with few prime factors. What is the reason for this? For instance, $f(3,4,5) = 1$, $f(36,77,85) = 3 * 11 * 7$, and $f(65,72,97)=39*5*2$. Can we put a bound on the number of prime factors in the numbers that $f$ spits out?

This ought to follow from the prime $k$-tuples conjecture. Proving it is another matter. 

Slightly simpler (but still out of reach), there should be infinitely many primes $p$, $q$, such that $2p+q$ is prime and $2p-q$ is 3 times a prime (e.g., $p=13$, $q=5$). Then the integer right-triangle with sides $4pq$ and $4p^2-q^2$ has area 6 times a product of 4 primes.

I am baffled by a nagging question regarding Modern Hebrew and Biblical Hebrew. Eliezer Ben-Yehudah is known to have revitalized Hebrew, in part by taking Biblical and post-Biblical (often Mishnaic and/or Rabbinic) Hebrew words, and sometimes Aramaic words, and adapting them to modern uses. But there are words that are not new to the world, and certainly could not have been new to our ancestors, which he apparently adapted from the classical sources because he could not find evidence of them there but found similar words that could be made to apply. The example I'm trying to understand is the Hebrew word for ""ice"".

In the Mishnah Berurah above why did the M""B need to describe ice as ""water which has frozen""? Furthermore, why did he have to Hebraicize the Aramaic word for ""freeze""? Is there no classical Hebrew word for ""ice"" or even ""freeze""? According to http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0131.htm ""קֶרַח"" translates as ""frost"". According to http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/גלד the word ""גלד"" is Aramaic for ""freeze"" and Hebrew (presumably modern) for ""scab"". I have also seen elsewhere in my search today that ""גלד"" is also used in the context of congealing (I believe in Hebrew).

Is there no other classical Hebrew source for a word that translates directly as ""ice""? It seems almost inconceivable that our ancestors did not have a word for this. Is it just that the word is unknown because our sources are limited to Biblical and post-Biblical writings?

Basically, I wanted to make it so that authentication could be done without keeping track of each user's session. This means less load on the database, and trivial to scale and cache. Here are the ""secrets"" kept by the server:


A private-key is kept in the source code of the application
A randomly generated salt is kept for each user


To make it sessionless, but making forging cookies not easy, this is the format of my cookies

expires=expiretimestamp
secret=hash(privatekey + otherinfo + username + hashedpassword + expires)
username=username


(with otherinfo being things like IP address, browser info, etc and with hashedpassword=hash(username + salt + password + privatekey) 

My understanding is that forging login cookies (not cracking the passwords) requires:


Source code access to the application, or a way to trick it to spit out the private key
Read-only access to the database to get the salt and hashedpassword


Whereas the traditional session method requires:


Write and read access to the database (to inject the session, or trick the web app into doing it for you)
Possibly source code access depending on how it works


Anyway, does this seem overly insecure to anyone? Are there any ways for me to improve on it and make it more secure(while keeping with the stateless/sessionless model)? Are there any existing authentication systems which use this stateless model? 

Also, the hashing method can be basically anything, ranging from SHA256 to Blowfish
",Earlz,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/1398,"This proposed system is a session handler used to maintain an authenticated state and your method of building session tokens is insecure.

For example,  using SQL Injection you can read most of the secret data from the database.  If you are using MySQL SQL Injection can be used to read files using the load_file() function which could be used to read the secret from a config file.

In general you should not reinvent the wheel when building a system.  I am sure your platform comes with a secure session handler because just about every web application will need one.

Session ID's should be purely random values and an entropy pool like /dev/urandom is an excellent choice.  Just because you are using the platform's session handler doesn't mean its configured properly.  I recommend reading the OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet.

2258,2850,question and answer 4535,"Does the Canon *.CR2/CRW format contain ""truly RAW"" data?","In my work I am dealing with *.CR2 raw images taken by a Canon DSLR in raw mode.
When I read about the format here, I was surprised to find that it has 4 TIFF IFDs which contain a) Original Size JPEG Image b) Thumbnail JPEG image c) Uncompressed RGB data d) Lossless JPEG image.

My impression until now was any camera captured RAW image file would have Raw Bayer Data i.e. R,Gr,B,Gb kind of bayer data, and some EXIF data about camera capture settings etc.

But after reading this CR2 specification I am slightly confused as to how can it have a RGB data or even surprisingly JPEG data. This seems to be the data after demosaicing(obtaining the missing R/G/B pixel data for the original sensor Bayer pattern). If thats the case I would not consider *.CR2 as ""truly raw"" data. It has done demosaicing before dumping the socalled raw file.

Am I missing something?

Does any other Camera Raw formats(e.g. Nikon - *.NEF, Kodac - *.kdc, Pentax - *.ptx/pef,...) have real raw bayer data without any processing done?
",goldenmean,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/2438,"I think you are most definitely missing something. Consider: JPG is used to store (and usually compress, lossy) images. Any image. What is an image? It is a great big bundle of pixels, when all is said and done.

The output from the camera sensor is a great big bundle of pixels, too. They just happen not to be full-colour RGB pixels, they are monochrome pixels - whether any individual pixel represents R G or B depends on its location on the image sensor, which is known. But their monochrome, colour-given-by-position nature does not mean that they cannot be usefully stored in the JPG way. A bundle of pixels is a bundle of pixels, and why reinvent the wheel?

Look more closely at the document. ""So with a BAYER grid of RG/GB, the even rows has interleaved HuffCode/Diff data for ...RGRGRG..., while the odd rows it is ...GBGBGB..."". So, the raw Bayer output is stored in a JPG format. Lossless, it is stated (otherwise we'd have a problem!) and presumably in more than 8 bits' depth. You have too cook this quite a lot to get a useful photo from it. 

The other JPG images are used for in-camera preview, histogram and such. It makes good sense to cook these once and for all as the image is taken, rather than having to do it on the fly each and every time you want to look at them. This also means that the computer can fish these out for thumbnail purposes once you unload the camera into the PC.

* I can't add a comment for some reason, so this goes here:
Goldenmean, what makes you think that there is a problem that you don't have full RGB info for each pixel? Assuming that you are creating a RAW format and have a measurement of 128 from a ""red"" sensor cell; you can either choose to store this as 128,0,0 or 128,128,128 or, of you are feeling clever, 128,""data from next cell"", ""data from the cell after that"" to save some space. Doesn't matter really. It's the RAW converter's job to keep track of this (though I'm sure the programmers would appreciate it if you documented how you chose to store your sensor data) and make an actual picture from it.

2275,2868,question and answer 4565,Career advice – mathematics,"I really need some opinions/advice on my situation.

My background

I'm studying for my master degree in mathematics. I have always (since I was 14) wanted to do my own research one day. As I grew older, I knew that mathematics was what I wanted to do. So I went to the university to study mathematics. After having encountered a course in group theory I knew that I belonged to the algebraic part of mathematics. I did my bachelor project in group theory and when I became a graduate student (September 2013), I took courses and made a project supporting my interest in algebra.

Along the way I created the vision that I would finish my master degree as a dedicated student in algebra. In order to realize this vision my plan was to study abroad for one semester taking new algebraic courses.

The situation

My situation today is that my study abroad semester begins tomorrow. As mentioned my dream is to do my own research, but more generally/important: I want to develop new ideas and be dedicated to something and I would love to follow/explore my passion.

My first thought (as many other students): I should get a PhD. So I did some research and figured out that there was an available position at the university I'm currently studying at in geometric group theory.

I don't know much about geometric group theory, but I do know that I love group theory. So I would really like to know if this is an opportunity or if I should just forget it.

I don't want to pursue a PhD for anything in this world. I just want to stay focus on creating a meaningful work life around my passion.

Any advice?



Further remarks

I'm a student from Denmark and I'm studying abroad in Austria for one semester. After my study abroad semester I still have to study one year for my master degree in Denmark. However this year consists of a half year with elective courses and a half year where I'm making my master's thesis. 

I don’t know much about the PhD position. I found it from a Google search (: “PhD position group theory”). There is only given a starting date and an e-mail address for contact. I’m going to attend a course held by the supervisor of the project, so the whole thing is a coincidence. 

I have investigated my opportunities for a position at my home university. One of my supervisors, a professor in group theory, told me that he couldn't offer me a position, since it was a question about money, but would like to recommend me. I don't think the university accepts PhD students without a master degree and the positions are without project descriptions.

However there is also another university (in Denmark) with a talent program where it is possible to get a PhD position without having a master degree. I contacted them and they told me I should apply after my study abroad semester (because I would have a stronger profile). But I don't know my chances.
",HelloProfile,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/12557,"I'm having a lot of trouble nailing down your question.  After reading it several times, I think you mean that you have an opportunity to go on to study a PhD in geometric group theory at your current university.  (Is it specifically relevant that you are going abroad tomorrow?  How does this fit in with the rest?)  From this I am guessing that you are not in the US, because in the US one would not have a position in ""geometric group theory"" specifically; one would just apply to the entire math department.  It could be helpful to know what country you are studying in.

So I think you are really asking whether you should go on to do a PhD?  You say that your motivation is to do mathematical research: for that you essentially need a PhD, yes.  


  Along the way I created the vision that I would finish my master degree as a dedicated student in algebra.


Yes, okay, you're studying algebra.  I feel like I'm missing some nuance here: what's the ""vision""?


  As mentioned my dream is to do my own research, but more generally/important: I want to develop new ideas and be dedicated to something and I would love to follow/explore my passion.


Again, I feel like I'm missing a nuance.  Doing your own research means precisely to developing your new ideas and being dedicated to something.  Doesn't everyone want to ""follow/explore their passion""?  That comes off sounding mean, which is not my intent: rather, I feel like you're trying to say something here and I'm missing it.


  I don't know much about geometric group theory, but I do know that I love group theory. So I would really like to know if this is an opportunity or if I should just forget it.


It seems clear that a PhD in geometric group theory is an indeed an opportunity to do everything that you said you wanted to do...in geometric group theory, which is a subfield of the field that you say you like.  Whether you will like GGT specifically seems best answered by learning some and finding out.  If the PhD program is so specifically invested in GGT that if you find out you don't want to do GGT per se then you'll need to leave the program, then you should study GGT on your own / during your master's degree first in order to find out whether it's interesting enough to you to spend years of your life on.  (I think GGT is really interesting.  If I hadn't done arithmetic geometry, I think I would have had fun with it.  So I assure you that there is nothing wrong with that subsubfield of mathematics!)


  I don't want to pursue a PhD for anything in this world. I just want to stay focus on creating a meaningful work life around my passion.

This is because the gate-source / base-emitter voltage differential is small, whereas the collector / drain may be tens or hundreds of volts different, so it provides a larger clearance for that voltage differential to have the collector / drain off on its own. The same holds true for DPAK / D2PAK transistors, where the middle pin is cut short and sticks up in the air; it's done to provide voltage clearance and you connect electrically through the collector / drain via the tab, which is (usually) the same piece of metal as the center pin.


I suppose there are certain transistor parts that are exceptions to these rules (most likely in the SOT-23 and SOT-323 packages) but I'm not aware of any -- still, always check the datasheet.

",Sathya,https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/244,"Possibility#1

If a trigger is not firing, then the insert/update/delete of the SObject is failing before the trigger is being invoked. For example, an after insert/update trigger will not fire if there are validation rule errors during the insert/update.  Or, if the before insert/update triggers execute an add.error to prevent the DML from committing.

Given that it works in stage but not PROD, you need to verify that Stage mirrors PROD in terms of validation rules and workflow field updates.

Possibility#2

Another thing to check is that if the stage testmethod uses @isTest(SeeAllData=true) it is highly likely to have different behavior in PROD than in Stage where the dataset size will be different.

Debug logs

As for debug log levels, start off by just running with Validation and Database logging and turn off Apex code and System logging to see why Possibility #1 (the DML operation is not committing) thus preventing the trigger from executing.

",mrbungle,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/73946,"
  Disclaimer: I don't know much about DAO. I typically use ADODB.


The expensive part of this code is opening and closing the recordset repeatedly. So, instead of opening and closing it every time this is triggered, open it once when the form is first loaded.

Private dbTemp As DAO.Something 'I don't know the right type
Private rsTemp As DAO.Recordset
Private rsTemp2 As DAO.Recordset

Private Sub Form_Load()
    ' code to open the entire recordset without a filter
End Sub

Private Sub Form_Unload()
    ' code to close and dispose of the recordsets
End Sub


Of course, now you don't have the specific record you're looking for when the event fires. You can use the Find and FindNext methods to filter the entire recordset down to what you need in the event procedure.

https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/ff194787.aspx



Of course, this is if I can't talk you into switching to ADODB for your purposes here. It supports parameterized queries, which (in theory) should execute a bit faster. This is because, to the best of my knowledge, DAO requests all of the data and then filters it down in memory on the local machine. An ADODB parameterized query allows for the plan to be cached and only returns the results of the statement.

Dim rst As ADODB.Recordset
Dim cmd as ADODB.Command

Const sql as String = _
    ""SELECT Field1 "" &amp; _
    ""FROM Table "" &amp; _
    ""WHERE CustomerID = ? and MonthYear = ?""

With cmd 
     .CommandType = adCmdText
     .CommandText = sql

     .Parameters.Append .CreateParameter(...)
     .Parameters.Append .CreateParameter(...)

     Set rst = .Execute
End With

' some code to set january's value

cmd.Parameters(1).Value = feburaryDate

Set rst = cmd.Execute

' some code to set february's value


Note how we simply pass the query a new value, instead of duplicating all of the query text? This is just one of ADODB's benefits.



One other, rather minor note.

I bet this code is all through your code base.

2345,2959,question and answer 4706,Probability density function with conditional distribution and correlation,"I am unsure with question c/d/e/f but I will give my answers for all questions I have attempted.

The random variables $X$ and $Y$ have joint probability density function

$f_{X,Y}(x,y) = ke^{-(x+y)},\ x&gt;0,\ y&gt;0,\ 0&lt;x&lt;y.$

(a) Sketch the region over which the joint probability density function is non-zero.

(b) Show that $k = 2.$

(c) Find the marginal Distribution of $X$; name the distribution and state its mean and variance.

(d) Find the conditional distribution of $Y|X = x$ for $x&gt;0$. Pay particular attention to the range of $Y$ conditional on $x$.

(e) Calculate $Pr(X + Y&lt;1)$.

(f) Given that $E(Y) = 1.5$ and $Var(Y) = 1.25$, calculate the correlation between $X$ and $Y$.

ANSWERS:

(a) Don't know how to draw on here but it's the area above $y=x$ and $y&gt;0$.

(b) Here I used double integration

$\int_0^\infty \int_0^y ke^{-(x+y)}dxdy = 1$

$\int_0^\infty [-ke^{-(x+y)}]_0^y dy = \int_0^\infty[-ke^{-y}+ke^{-2y}]dy$

$[ke^{-y}-\frac{k}{2}e^{-2y}]_0^\infty = [ke^{-0} - \frac{k}{2}e^{-2\cdot0}]-[ke^{-\infty}-\frac{k}{2}e^{-2\cdot \infty}] = [k - \frac{k}{2}]-[0] = \frac{k}2$

Hence $\frac{k}{2}=1$ and $k=2$

(c) $P_x(x)=\int_yP_{X,Y}(x,y)dy=\int_0^\infty2e^{-(x+y)}dy$

$[-2e^{-(x+y)}]_0^\infty= -2e^{-x}$

Presuming that the integration I have done is correct the marginal distribution of $X$ is $-2e^{-x}$ and hence this is a gamma distribution as the limits are $(0,\infty)$ and it just doesn't match the binomial distribution either.

Gamma distribution: $\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\cdot \beta^\alpha}\cdot x^{\alpha-1}\cdot e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}}$

Hence $\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\cdot \beta^\alpha}\cdot x^{\alpha-1}\cdot e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}} = -2e^{-x}$

This is where I have gone wrong as using $\beta = 1$ to leave $e^{-x}$ as that i then need to find:

$\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\cdot 1^\alpha}\cdot x^{\alpha-1} = -2$ and using $\alpha =1$ to make $x^0$ and getting rid of $x$ but this makes $1=-2$.

(d) unsure how to do this question also.

(e) Adding the line $y=1-x$ to the graph from *(a)*we get a new region to find

$\int_0^1 \int_x^{1-x}2e^{-(x+y)}dydx$

$\int_0^1[-2e^{-(x+y)}]_x^{1-x}dx$

$\int_0^1[(-2e^{-2x})-(-2e^{-1})]dx$

$[e^{-2x}+2xe^{-1}]_0^1$

$e^0 + 0 - e^{-2} + 2e^{-1} = 1-\frac{1}{e^2}+\frac{2}{e}$

Hence $Pr(x+y&lt;1) = 1-\frac{1}{e^2}+\frac{2}{e}$

(f) Unsure how to do.
",Matt,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/45783,"On (c), we want to ""integrate out"" $y$. So the density function of $X$ is
$$\int_{y=x}^\infty 2e^{-x}e^{-y}\,dy.$$

$$\frac{f_{X,Y}(x,y)}{f_X(x)}.$$
Note that the conditional density is $0$ for $y\lt x$.

On (e), the setup is good. There is a small sign error in the calculation. The number obtained is impossible, it is greater than $1$.

On (f), we will first need the covariance, that is, $E(XY)-E(X)E(Y)$. For that, we need to find 
$$\iint_D (xy) 2e^{-(x+y)}\,dydx,$$
where $D$ is the region where our joint density is positive.

2351,2966,question and answer 4720,How do I keep drawer knobs from loosening over time?,"I see knobs like this on cabinets, dressers, and closet doors. They are held in place with a single wood screw.


Very often they are loose. I guess when we grab them we often impart a slight twist. Also, temperature and humidity changes cause the wood to swell and shrink. The system is biased towards unscrewing, so over time they loosen up.

My DIY instinct says that this is bad. That the screw will strip out the knob, or it will ream out the hole in the door. Well, it seems sloppy.

When I notice one, I give it a twist to tighten. Sometimes I put my finger over the screw head to hold it still. When it's really stiff, I might get out the multitool. Sometimes, in my enthusiasm, I strip out the knob. Doh!

What's the best way to deal with these things? For example:


Use handles that take two screws.
Put a washer under the head to distribute the load, then make them really tight.
Keep them all tight according to a schedule.
Only use knobs made of strong wood, and keep them tight.
Use knobs that take a machine screw instead of a wood screw.
Put wood glue in the screw hole.
Use door designs that don't need a handle.

",Vlad Seremet,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2779830,"If you always want to sort by x, then you can hard-code it into the sort function, and just pass a pointer to the array to sort:

    // if (arr[i].x &lt; arr[j].x) {/* i sorts before j */}

quicksort(arr, 0, n-1);


To specify a class member to sort by, you need a pointer-to-member, not a pointer; something like:

void quicksort(point * arr, int point::*member, int left, int right){
    // test points with 
    // if (arr[i].*member &lt; arr[j].*member) {/* i sorts before j */}

void quicksort(RandIter begin, RandIter end, Compare compare) {
    // test points with

2363,2978,question and answer 4737,What are the benefits of owning a physical book?,"I have seen this question about updates of the D&amp;D 4th Edition books, and it got me thinking.
Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. 


I think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.

So what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want.

What is this, what is it good for and how should I as a DM grant it?

It looks like it's simply a way to grant advantage for good role-playing? Is this what it's meant for or does it have more meaning than this?
",wax eagle,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/1084,"To players, mechanically, Inspiration is a token you spend to gain advantage on a roll, and that’s all it is. You can only ever have one of these tokens in your possession, which is incentive to use Inspiration up quick and not hoard it. You can also pass that token to others, so you might do that if you’re about to get a second one.

The true reason Inspiration exists, though, is this: it's a mechanical reward for playing the way the Dungeon Master appreciates. The guidance is thin, and that’s what it comes down to, though the guidance doesn't say it in such explicit terms. To support saying that, I’ll quote in full everything (everything) from the Basic Rules about how you acquire Inspiration, barring the example, found on pages 35-36:


  Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw.
  
  Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.
  
  (further down, after the example...) Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.


That’s all the guidance there is in the Basic Rules. The guidance suggests to use Inspiration for roleplaying consistent with one’s character sheet, but then gives the DM the freedom to choose to award it however they want:


  Your DM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.


So given that, and the fact the DM is the only one who can create new Inspiration, the entire mechanic comes down to being a device to encourage the players to play the way the DM wants.

That can be used to constructive or destructive ends. People are going to have Opinions about how Inspiration should be used, and what ways are good or bad, but the Basic Rules guidance begins and ends at the above. That guidance certainly seems to fit in with D&amp;D’s established notion that the DM has precedence over the players, and enhances that idea.

Inspiration could be used like Fate points, and awarded as compensation and reward for a player making a mechanically suboptimal choice. (Apparently, the Starter Set suggests as much!) However, D&amp;D 5e presently lacks pretty much all of the mechanical support and a large amount of play guidance that drives Fate points working the way they do. Note the conspicuous absence of “the players can suggest they should probably get it” in the guidance, for instance. Choosing to use Inspiration this way is entirely a choice of the group. The management of Inspiration can also be made by group cooperation, but again, that’s a choice of the group.

It seems the authors could have included Inspiration to be a solution to all those complaints of “my player isn’t roleplaying consistent with their character’s alignment and story!” - since then the DM just penalises that player with no Inspiration whilst they’re doing that. I have Opinions on whether this is healthy for the game, and so will others.

At the end of the day: consider whether there’s behaviour you want to encourage in your game, and if it’s healthy to provide mechanical incentive for players to behave that way. If so, use Inspiration for that.

",William,https://superuser.com/users/367462,"The fact that your are getting assigned IPs on two different subnets implies you have two DHCP servers on the directly attached network.

Usually, I'd recommend using something like dhcp_probe -f eth0 or roguechecker to find out which IPs on your network are serving DHCP but you already know which they are. Namely, 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.102.1. 

You have two options to get internet connectivity AND be able to connect to the 192.168.1.0 network at the same time. Both will require disabling or removing the DHCP server on 192.168.1.1 and letting 192.168.102.1 assign you an IP for internet access.

Methods follow:

1) Add a static routing entry to the linux box that tells it that 192.168.1.0 is directly attached.

route add -net 192.168.1.0/24 wlan0 should work for this.

2) Add a static routing entry to the router that tells it 192.168.1.0 is directly attached.

This would be specific to your router/firmware, but since you're running DD-WRT you can easily find the information on adding a static route. As a note, your gateway should be 0.0.0.0 for directly connected nets.

2387,3011,question and answer 4799,"Do airlines replace cancelled short-haul flights by buses? If not, why not?","When trains are cancelled (at least in Europe), and there are no alternative ways to get travellers to their destination by train a little bit later, there are often replaced by buses to get travellers to their destination.

Currently, I've been rebooked twice to get on a flight to a destination that is only 383 km by road.  Originally I should have flown on Monday evening, and currently I'm booked on a flight Wednesday morning, effectively a 36 hour delay.  If the airline had booked a bus, all Monday evening passengers would have arrived to the other airport by Monday night, with perhaps a 4–5 hour delay.  To me, it would make sense from the perspective of customer satisfaction.

Does it happen that airlines offer to bus passengers to their destination when cancellations lead to multi-day delays, but a bus would take only several hours?  If not, why not?



Many passengers, including me, travel to destinations beyond the airport that is 383 km by road, but travelling the short-haul flight segment by bus in order to wait for the first available connection would still benefit travellers.
",gerrit,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/2509,"I've been offered train connections (rather than bus) in two intra-German cases with Lufthansa where the flight was cancelled, but a good ICE (high speed train) connection between the two cities exist. Basically airline staff gave me the choice: be re-booked for next day, or take the train and arrive a few hours late.

(The fact that Lufthansa often cooperates with Deutsche Bahn anyway may play a role here, including that some connections marketed with regular flight numbers are actually high speed train connections - especially short hops from Frankfurt, e.g. Frankfurt-Stuttgart. But: the particular trains I was given were NOT such trains and I was simply given a normal train ticket + reservation by the airline.)

In this case I suppose cost for accommodation or train would have worked out roughly the same for the airline, so they offered the choice to the customer - but that's a guess of course.

2403,3030,question and answer 4829,What creates this strange flare and how to prevent it?,"I shot at a concert for the first time. The pictures were pretty good for the capability of my equipment, but on some shots, the light has a very strange flare. It isn't the usual rays, but some soft, non-symmetric form which I find quite strange, and, on most shots, distracting. 



On this image, you can see it just above Gino's head and also behind his back, to the right of the mic stand. I am not sure if the slight blue lines on the left side of the picture (they form a triangle aimed at Chris's head, maybe not visible on all monitors) are part of the problem or if they come from a different light source. 

What makes them appear, and how do I avoid them? 

I shot with a D90 with a 18-200 lens, no filters or hoods attached. The settings were quite strained (iso 3200, often at max length and max aperture for the length. This specific picture is 1/125, f 5.3, 95 mm). 
",rumtscho,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/2099,"Your other choice is to use a hood.  That will help avoid the flares from off the frame.  

It also appears that the flare is accentuated by some CA as well.  Stopping down a little or using a brighter lens that is better corrected may help.  

Lastly, don't use UV filters indoors/at night unless they are multi-coated to remove such reflections.  When in use, they provide two additional surfaces for flaring.  It's better to leave them off in these situations.

Still, having flares used for dramatic/visual effect (eg: Star Trek) is in vogue.  If you like this look, do all the reverse!

UPDATE: Sorry for the confusion. This question more about situation when I set internalFormat in glTexImage2D to something like ""bgra8"" but videodriver internally convert data to another format, like ""rgba8"".
",KindDragon,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/8399,"Generally most hardware doesn't suport 3-component texture formats so in this specific example you can make a reasonably safe assumption that it's converted.  A 3-component OpenGL texture is actually 4-component in hardware but with the alpha component ignored/set to 255/whatever.

http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Common_Mistakes#Texture_upload_and_pixel_reads
(That ""common mistakes"" page is a goldmine - bookmark it now!)

For a more general case, glTexSubImage2D performance can give you a good indication of whether or not the upload must go through a software conversion path.  You'd go about this during program startup - just create an empty texture (via glTexImage2D with NULL data), then issue a bunch of glTexSubImage2D calls, each followed by a glFinish to ensure it completes.  Ignore the first one because caches/states/etc are being setup for it, and time the rest of them.  Repeat this for a few different formats and pick the fastest.

Another alternative - seeing as you've tagged this question ""Windows"" - is to create a D3D device at startup (just after you've created your window but before you init OpenGL) then use D3D to check for format support.  While OpenGL allows for software conversion to a valid internal format, D3D doesn't - if it's not supported by the hardware you can't do it.  Then destroy D3D and bring up OpenGL.  (This technique can also be used for querying other stuff that OpenGL doesn't let you query directly).

It's actually a useful rule of thumb to cross-check what you're doing in OpenGL with the D3D documentation.  If D3D can't do something then it can be a good indication that the something in question is not supported in hardware.  Not always true, but a useful starting place.

So, when you are building an application, and you are listing products available to order, you know the ids of thoses products. And then you can do something like :

INSERT INTO tblOrder(OName, Pid)
VALUES ('name_choosen', [product_id_selected])


In your case, for sql training, you do :

INSERT INTO tblOrder(OName, Pid)
SELECT 'name_of_order', Pid

WHERE PName='IPhone'


Or

INSERT INTO tblOrder(OName, Pid)
SELECT 'name_of_order'

2431,3060,question and answer 4874,Lychrel calculator (Project Euler 55),"
  If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
  
  Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,

349 + 943 = 1292,
1292 + 2921 = 4213
4213 + 3124 = 7337

  
  That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
  
  Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers,
  like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a
  palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel
  number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the
  purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel
  until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every
  number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in
  less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing
  power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In
  fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty
  iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664
  (53 iterations, 28-digits).
  
  Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves
  Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.
  
  How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?


This is my solution:

from datetime import datetime

candidates = []

def reverse(number):
    ''' Returns the reverse order of an integer,
        for example: reverse(123) returns the integer 321 '''
    number = str(number)
    return int(number[::-1])

def is_lychrel(number):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is a lychrel candidate,
        but works only with numbers from 1 to 10000 '''
    iterated = number + reverse(number)
    for i in range(25):
        rev_iterated = reverse(iterated)
        if iterated != rev_iterated:
            iterated = iterated + rev_iterated
        else:
            return False
    return True

if __name__ == '__main__':

    start_time = datetime.now()

    for number in range(10001):
        if is_lychrel(number):
            candidates.append(number)

    time = datetime.now() - start_time # To get the time of the calculation

    print('In {} were found {} lychrel candidates'.format(time, len(candidates)))
    print(' '.join(map(str, candidates)), 'are candidates.')
    suml = input('Press ENTER to close ')


On my PC (with Intel Atom 2GHz), I got it with .4 seconds.  Could you offer suggestions on making it run faster?
",matheussilvapb,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/37913,"1. Comments on your code


Python has a built-in module, timeit, for measuring the execution time of small code snippets. So there is no need for all that fussing about with datetime.
Project Euler problem 55 says:


  you are given that for every number below ten thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations


but your code only tries 25 iterations. It happens to be the case that 25 iterations are enough in this case, but how did you figure that out? If you had a mathematical proof that showed that 25 iterations were enough, then that would be fair enough, but I suspect that in fact you re-ran the program with different values for the count of iterations until you found that smallest one that produces the right answer. This seems like cheating to me: if you are willing to do that, why not just replace the whole program with:

print(answer)


which would be even faster?
The problem statement asks:


  How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?


but you test range(10001) which is off by one. Luckily for you, 10,000 is not a Lychrel number, so this doesn't lead to an error.
You've made candidates into a global variable, and run some of your code at top level. This makes it hard to test your program from the interactive interpreter. You need something like this:

def problem55(n):
    """"""Return a list of Lychrel candidates below n.""""""
    candidates = []
    for number in range(n):
        if is_lychrel(number):
            candidates.append(number)
    return candidates


and then you can test it like this:

&gt;&gt;&gt; from timeit import timeit
&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(lambda:problem55(10000), number=100)
8.279778157011606



2. Speeding it up


The problem statement only asks how many Lychrel numbers there are, so there is no need to construct a list of them.
Function calls in Python are moderately expensive, so you can save some time by inlining them. This leads to an implementation like this:

def problem55_1(n, m):
    """"""Return the count of numbers below n that do not lead to a
    palindrome after m iterations of reversal and addition.

    """"""
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        r = int(str(i)[::-1])
        for _ in range(m):
            i += r
            r = int(str(i)[::-1])
            if i == r:
                break
        else:
            count += 1
    return count


which is about 16% faster than yours:

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(lambda:problem55_1(10000, 50), number=100)
6.93482669594232

Janne suggested that you could speed things up by caching the numbers already found to be Lychrel and non-Lychrel, and you replied:


  doing that is going to require more conditions and probably is going to be the same running time or even worse


which is a bit of a defeatist attitude. Certainly the code gets more complex when you add caching, but it's not a priori obvious whether this costs more than it saves, or saves more than it costs. The best way to find out is to knuckle down and try it:

def problem55_2(n, m):
    """"""Return the count of numbers below n that do not lead to a
    palindrome after m iterations of reversal and addition.

    """"""
    lychrel = set()
    nonlychrel = set()
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        j = i
        if i in lychrel:
            count += 1
            continue
        stack = [i]
        r = int(str(i)[::-1])
        for _ in range(m):
            i += r
            if i in lychrel:
                count += 1
                lychrel.update(stack)
                break
            if i in nonlychrel:
                nonlychrel.update(stack)
                break
            stack.append(i)
            r = int(str(i)[::-1])
            if i == r:
                nonlychrel.update(stack)
                break
        else:
            count += 1
            lychrel.update(stack)
    return count


I find that this is about twice as fast as your code:

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(lambda:problem55_2(10000, 50), number=100)
3.935654202941805

One final tweak from me. Now that we are caching, the order in which we check numbers for the Lychrel property matters. As you iterate the reverse-and-add process, the numbers get bigger. So if we start with the larger numbers and proceed downwards, then we are more likely to get cache hits. So I tried replacing the line:

    for i in range(n):


with

    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):


and got a further small speedup:

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(lambda:problem55_3(10000, 50), number=100)

2432,3061,question and answer 4875,Isn’t the FAQ label obsolete by now?,"Don’t get me wrong in the beginning of reading this. I really mean the label and not the content of FAQ. The content is very useful if its’ made the right way (as here on ux.se), but there are plenty of examples where it isn’t. The real question concerns the label which is a convention I’d like to challenge.

History

In 1647 Matthew Hopkins wrote The Discovery of Witches which were introduced as ""Certain Queries answered"" and had the form of a list of Question and Answer, even if the topic is inappropriate by today’s standards. The label FAQ origins from the early 1980s mailing lists where NASA hoped to get new users read the old mail conversations, which were not the case. Instead the same questions were answered again and again and the need for FAQ was born. The acronym FAQ was invented by Eugene Miya and FAQ were later used in mail on a weekly basis at first and later on as a daily mail.


  Today FAQ is more frequently used to refer to the list, and a text consisting of questions and their answers is often called an FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually frequently asked, if they are asked at all.[1]


Problem

Acronyms are generally bad, since it excludes those who do not know the meaning. They either have to search for the acronym, if they are interested, or just ignore it. If a label is ignored, there is not much use of it and an entire section of valid content is lost by bad labeling. However, it is a very strong web convention which might lead to confusion over time for experienced users.
Also the original meaning have changed (see quote), which also implies that the label would be wrong.

Question

Isn’t the FAQ label obsolete by now? and if so How do we relabel it to suit both experienced and new users?



Edit: I’d really like to know why we can or cannot change the label FAQ. Current answer does not meet that criterion.

[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAQ
",Benny Skogberg,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/4679,"My own view of the topic is that the label FAQ is obsolete, for a number of reasons. To begin with, it’s an acronym which is bad in itself since new users of the web doesn't immediately get what it means. This means that a whole section, which could be useful, is lost altogether. Second it is not always frequently asked questions, but questions that content providers would like the users to read. In those cases it is more accurate to label the FAQ as help. 

Still, I'm part of a minority, both when it comes to answers and votes on this topic. The following graph (a snapshot from march 22nd) makes it clear to me that it isn't as easy as I first thought. The User Experience Stackexchange community is strongly against relabeling FAQ to something else.



My second question ""How do we relabel it to suit both experienced and new users?"" were answered by Hillier. His answer was to look at the some of the worlds leading websites such as Google, Facebook and Twitter, who doesn't use FAQ but just help. Their help content is extensive and not always in the Question and Answer form, thus it isn't a real FAQ section. 

If one are going to change the label, one could use double coding, using both the suggested ""help"" and the acronym ""faq"" together. Then new user would know what help is, and the more experienced user would know that the help section is in a form of frequently asked questions. Like the following:

The example of Jesus after His resurrection, Who, while possessing a body of flesh and bones, still retains all the qualities that are usually ascribed only to God, for example, His omnipresence, could go along with this belief.

Idolatry was so antithetical to the Jewish understanding would have made giving God any flesh or image heretical to unthinkable. 

That said (and I say this as a non-Mormon), the primary problem and setting in which Joseph Smith either wrote or was called in (depending on your belief), was not one in which idolatry was an issue. As such, it is difficult to apply a Jewish understanding to a Mormon prophet. Would a Jew think this silly? Sure.

I.e. Enfield has 150 cc more than the Duke. But KTM produces 25 BHP of power, whereas Enfield only 19 BHP. How is it so?

",limovala,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/3292,"There are two sides to the design and efficiency coin. As a rule of thumb, more modern motors would have better characteristics due to general improvements in manufacturing (machining tolerances are smaller, for instance), and engineering. Liquid-cooled motors are more efficient, as a rule, than air-cooled, and so forth. However, there are also other considerations.

For instance, I have a 250 cc standard motorcycle (Suzuki TU250X). It uses the same basic engine that Suzuki used on its small DR dual-sports, GN standards, and GZ cruisers since early 80s. However, for the new fuel-injected version that Suzuki introduced in the last few years, the newly re-designed top end (cylinder and head) caused it to make less horse-power than earlier carburetted versions (16 v. 20). Why so?

There are multiple factors for such re-design. First of all, the amount of valves were reduced from four to two. Obviously, it would reduce power, because the more, and the bigger the valves, the more air-fuel mixture can be brought in and out. However, the less valves means less maintenance. And for a commuter motorcycle, fuel economy was more important than sheer power.

Design of the valve openings and cam shaft was also rethought to produce more useful power band for this motorcycle. Having high theoretical horsepower does not mean that that power is readily available. Small sport-bikes and sport-like bikes like Duke, CBR250R or Ninja 250 capable of a lot more horsepower (25‒27 in stock form), however that horsepower is available at high RMP (8000‒10 000 or thereabouts), and in regular street riding it is never achieved, unless some one races by overreving the motor on lower gears. TU250X engine is designed to give mild and more even power band, that does not peak as high, but allows more useful power and torque at lower RPM one would use most often in regular urban traffic. As a result, this bike would not win any races and it takes awhile to get up to high speed (though people pushed it past 135 km/h (85 mph) while drafting), but it is a very capable commuter and easily allows over 200 kg of useful load (rider, passenger, and some gear).

Likewise, Bullet 350 affected by two of these factors: it has very old engine that harkens from 1950s, and it is a standard motorcycle workhorse that is designed for commuting, and not racing. Even the brand new RE 500 cc unit-construction engine with EFI is not that powerful for the same reason.

2482,3117,question and answer 4965,Shape of rotating rope (lasso problem?),"Let's take a wire or a rope. I usually do this with a chain or my scarf.

I fixate one end in my hand and apply rotation (by subtle movements of this endpoint like spinning a lasso). The rope gets into rotation and obtains certain bent shape:


Some part is missing because cellphone cameras ain't great for high-speed photos but I hope you can imagine all the scarf.

The question is: how can I calculate/predict this shape?

Although this problem doesn't seem that bizarre, I have never seen any solution. Nor I have found this question asked anywhere on internet... Must be because I just don't know how to formulate it without pictures.

Also by taking longer rope I get more than one bend:


I apoligize for the quality again. It is even harder to rotate this while taking picture. The form is not spiral, it is more like a shape in a plane that's rotating.

I'll be thankful for explanations, solutions, links or at least a correct formulation of this problem.
",Džuris,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/12727,"It's an interesting problem. I've tried to study it neglecting the air friction, which is likely to be nonnegligible. So let's parametrize the rope of length $L$ by the vector $(z(l), r(l))$, with $l$ being the curviligne coordinate along the rope and $(z,r)$ the cylindrical coordinates of the rope (I've omitted $\theta$, which can be assumed to be constant in the rotating frame [see my comment below this post for a justification of this omission]). 
In the rotating frame, the potential energy of the rope is
$$E_p=\int_0^L \mu dl\left(gz-\frac12\Omega^2r^2\right)$$
and the definition of the curviligne integral gives the constraint $r&#39;^2+l&#39;^2=1$. So the problem can be translated into minimizing the following quantity :
$$\begin{align}
 \int_0^Ldl \mathcal L(z,r;z&#39;,r&#39;;l) &amp; &amp;
 \text{with } \mathcal L(z,r;z&#39;,r&#39;;l)=\mu gz - \tfrac12\mu\Omega^2r^2 - \lambda(z&#39;^2+r&#39;^2).
\end{align}$$
One should not forget (as I did in a first tentative answer) that the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ depends on $l$/
It is a standard Euler-Lagrange problem and its solution is given by
$$\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial z}-\frac{d}{dl}\frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial z}&amp;=0&amp;
&amp;\text{and}&amp;
 \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial r}-\frac{d}{dl}\frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial r}&amp;=0&amp;
\end{align}$$
The equation in $z$ becomes
$$\begin{align}
\mu g&amp;=-2\frac{d}{dl}(\lambda z&#39;)&amp;
\lambda z&#39;&amp;= -\tfrac12 \mu g(l-l_0),
\end{align}$$
where $l_0$ is an integration constant. For the optimal solution $z&#39;\le 0$, since replacing $z&#39; by -|z&#39;|$ can only decrease $\mathcal L$, ans we have $z&#39;=-\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}$. One has therefore
$$\lambda=\frac{\mu g(l-l_0)}{2\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}}$$.
The equation in $r$ is then
$$-\mu\Omega^2r=-2\frac{d}{dl}(\lambda r&#39;) =-\frac{d}{dl}\frac{\mu g(l-l_0)r&#39;}{\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}}$$
We have then the following equation to integrate
$$0=\frac{\Omega^2}{g}r(1-r&#39;^2)^{3/2}-r&#39;(1-r&#39;^2)-(l-l_0)r&#39;&#39;.$$
I don't know how to integrate it analytically, but when $l-l_0&lt;0$, it seems that we can have oscillations.

Edited to add :

If one looks at the signs of $r&#39;$ and $r&#39;&#39;$ as function of $r$ and $r&#39;$ for a fixed $l$, one can quickly draw some arrows in phase space (i.e.) and see that the flow goes ""in circles"" when $l&lt;l_0$ and tends asymptotically to the curve $\frac{\Omega^2}{g}r=\frac{r&#39;}{\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}}$ when $l&gt;l0$. So one can expect a finite number of oscillations of the rope. But the whole question is then how $l_0$ relates to the parameters of the system.

Edit: In the limit of almost vertical rope ($r'\ll1$), the equation becomes
$$0=\frac{\Omega^2}{g}r-r&#39;-(l-l_0)r&#39;&#39;$$
which is simpler. And indeed, Wolfram Alpha has an analytical solution using modified Bessel functions.

Futuyma states that if natural selection occurs at the species level it does not occur at the individual level: 


  Neither gene selection nor species selection has molded the advantageous characteristics of individual organisms; rather, they have affected properties at the gene level or at the species level. 


But how does natural selection occuring at the species level not affect individuals? Surely any selective advantage of a particular species must occur among particular individuals of that species. For example, if Species A is selected because it is browner than Species B, this will be because individuals of Species A are browner than individuals of Species B. 
",luciano,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1216,"I think there is some misunderstanding there, natural selection does act on an individual and can be determined by its genes (assuming there is genetic variance underlying the variance in trait). Those with more favourable genes will have more favourable phenotypes and thus be more likely to survive/reproduce. However, (genetic) evolution does not occur within an individual, evolution occurs at the population level as the frequencies of existing and new mutations changes over time or space.

Following from your example: Two morphs of a species exist, brown and white (like the classic peppered moth), which is genetically determined, and one has a selective advantage - let's say brown. Thus all individuals of the brown morph are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time the genes causing the brown phenotype will increase in frequency in the population and frequency of brown (white) moths will have increased (decreased).

I suspect it would be helpful if you included more of the text preceding the statement. 

Edit: having seen @fileunderwaters answer, which arrived seconds before I posted mine, I see that I was right, more of the text was useful :)

So going back to the moths, an individual moth would not be able to change it's trait in response to selection.

2515,3159,question and answer 5030,How do I opt-out of the Social Security system?,"How do I opt-out of the Social Security system and give up my Social Security Number? If I do this, am I then exempt from paying Social Security income tax?
",Jesse,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/9631,"To give up your Social Security number, you would probably have to renounce your citizenship, since merely leaving the United States, becoming a permanent expatriate, etc. wouldn't be enough. 

Paying Social Security taxes is mandatory, however. Even if your income exceeds the means testing limits, you are still required to pay Social security (FICA) taxes on the income that falls beneath it. 

That being said, there are several groups that are exempt from paying Social Security taxes, based on what I can scrounge up through online searching. 


College students who work under the Federal Work Study program. 1
State or local government workers (like teachers, city workers, police, firefighters, etc.) hired before March 31, 1986 and who participate in their employers' alternative retirement systems. 
Self-employed workers with with yearly net earnings less than $400
Ministers, members of certain religious orders, and Christian Science practitioners may file IRS Form 4361 to exempt themselves from self-employment taxes, including FICA taxes. The picture is more complicated than this, however (see below).
All members of certain religious groups, like the Amish, Mennonites, etc. 2
Election workers earning $1,000 or less a year.
Minor children with earnings from household work but for whom household work is not their principal occupation.


If you aren't part of one of these groups or you joined them after already being enrolled in the Social Security system (i.e. paid FICA taxes, etc.), you don't have to take Social Security payments, but you are not exempt from FICA payroll taxes. This means that you can't simply become Amish and be exempt if you've already paid into the system.

Many of these answers were listed here, but the only stated source is ""Wikipedia,"" so take it with a grain of salt. I've tried to provide other sources where I could. 

Ministers/religious officials

I mentioned that the situation with ministers and/or religious officials is more complicated. Among other things, these officials need to certify that they are religiously opposed to receiving public insurance benefits and they have to file by a certain deadline soon after earning a certain amount as a minister. Furthermore, if you file this exemption and choose/chose to revoke it later on, e.g. by filing IRS Form 2031, during the short time windows when this is possible, you're no longer eligible to file for another exemption. Once you revoke your exemption, you won't get another one. 

Also note that this opt-out only applies to income earned as part of your ministry. For non-ministerial income, you're still required to pay FICA taxes even if you follow the procedure(s) above.

If you do opt-out

Clearly, opting out of the Social Security isn't easy, or even feasible, for many people, but if you are outside the system, common sense dictates that you should insure yourself against risks that would usually be covered, at least in part, by Social Security. Dave Ramsey maintains a list of such investments that he recommends ministers and religious officials who opt out of the Social Security system should purchase, but the rationale applies to anyone who isn't part of the system. 


Term life insurance that covers 10x your annual income. Normally, your spouse or dependents will receive a Social Security death benefit upon your death, but if you opt-out, your family doesn't have this option. Since the death benefit is a pittance ($255), however, you may want life insurance regardless of your participation in Social Security.
Long-term disability insurance. If you become disabled, you won't receive disability benefits, so you'll may want insurance to cover this risk.
Long-term care insurance. Similar to disability insurance, you may want additional income to cover you in case you require long-term care, and Medicaid isn't enough.
Other retirement savings. If you're not going to be paying money into Social Security, it makes sense to invest that money in some form of tax-advantaged or tax-sheltered retirement account to ensure that you still have some income in retirement. You won't be receiving Social Security checks, but you'll still need income.


Depending on your circumstances, it's may be a good idea to invest in some or all of these instruments anyway (especially tax-advantaged/tax-sheltered retirement accounts), because Social Security doesn't cover 100% of the risks you'll face, but that decision is highly specific to each person/family.

How come we only see one use of a runabout in TNG? Is it only about the crew size on board? Yet shuttles have been shown to carry quite a number of people too? Is it speed?
",The Byzantine,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/9382,"The difference between a runabout and a shuttlecraft is a matter of size and capability. Most of the time, their duties were interchangeable so either ship could be used. With the ability to customize ships in the Federation, there are numerous designs for shuttlecraft which includes vehicles such as the Delta Flyer (VOY) or the Captain's Yacht, Cousteau (TNG).


Shuttlecraft were small ships assigned to starships, used primarily in cargo transportation, short trips for species which experience transporter difficulties or anxiety, or movement through electromagnetic phenomenon which might disrupt or challenge transporter technologies. 
Shuttlecraft had to be fit during the TOS period with technologies to allow them to be used with warp drives. By the TNG series, shuttlecraft came standard with relatively short-hop warp capacities (some light years allowing them to be used as exploration vehicles). There were many different classes of shuttlecraft depending on the duties being carried out.
Runabouts were slightly larger than shuttlecraft but smaller than starships. Runabouts were warp-capable, had personal transporters and usually had a crew of four personnel. Properly fitted, they could function as transports, scientific vehicles or medical evacuation vehicles. Runabouts were used primarily on space stations such as Deep Space Nine (DS9) as a means of travel between the Federation, Cardassian and Bajoran sectors of space.




Runabout specifications included deflectors and phaser arrays. But they were not meant to sustain much damage, despite the fact they could be used in combat.

It would seem this should be able to be done but I haven't the faintest how. Any help, and in particular working code that could generate the filters (Octave or other open source preferred) would be much appreciated!
",psandersen,https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/3142,"Suppose that we had two channels encoded in some form in two signals according to a matrix.  Recovering the original signals would be straightforward using the matrix inverse (or impossible, if the inverse did not exist).  The situation is no different here, except that the matrix is not square, so you cannot use the conventional matrix inverse.  You can, however, use a pseudoinverse or generalized inverse to reconstruct the original signals.  

Other matrices which are not equal to an inverse may work also succeed, and may in fact sound better.  I don't know the psychoacoustic situation, but it may more sense to do some transform based on the position of speakers for example. Certainly, the inverse seems like a good place to start.

I rewrote your encoder table as a 2x5 input matrix $ E $, and used Wolfram Alpha to determine the inverse, $ D = E^{-1} $.  Here is the 5x2 result it provided, using $ i $ as the imaginary unit, with $ j = i $ and $ k = -i $.

$$
D = \frac{1}{18(46+6\sqrt{2})} \begin{bmatrix}
405 &amp; -3(27 - 36\sqrt{2}) \\
-3(27 - 36\sqrt{2}) &amp; 405 \\
6(18+27\sqrt{2}) &amp; 6(18+27\sqrt{2}) \\
-i(27\sqrt{3} + 99\sqrt{6}) &amp; i(63\sqrt{3} + 27\sqrt{6}) \\
-i(63\sqrt{3} + 27\sqrt{6}) &amp; i(27\sqrt{3} + 99\sqrt{6}) 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

As one would expect, the decoding matrix shows left/right symmetry.

Now we can express the encoding/decoding operations as:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
L_{encoded} \\
R_{encoded}
\end{bmatrix} = E \space{} \begin{bmatrix}
L \\
R \\
C \\
L_{rear} \\
R_{rear} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
L' \\
R' \\
C' \\
L_{rear}' \\
R_{rear}' \\
\end{bmatrix} = D \space{} \begin{bmatrix}
L_{encoded} \\
R_{encoded}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Now you can easily obtain formulas to express the three front components as functions of the encoded left and right signals.  For the two rear components, you have an equation in the time domain with a complex component.

Looking at the left rear component, and converting constants from the matrix $ D $ to numeric form:
$$
L_{rear}'[n] = -i0.2949 L_{encoded}[n] + i0.1787 R_{encoded}[n]
$$

The Hilbert transform can be used to remove the imaginary unit, because this has the same effect on the frequency domain of performing a ±90º phase shift.  The Hilbert transform only needs to be applied once, since convolution ($ * $) is distributive and commutative and all other good things.
$$
L_{rear}'[n] = (-0.2949 L_{encoded}[n] + 0.1787 R_{encoded}[n]) * H[n]
$$

The operating principle, then, is that the encoding technique functions in part by encoding the left/right rear components in quadrature.

The Hilbert transform is infinitely long, so it must be truncated and expressed as either a FIR filter, or depending on your circumstances, a FFT-IFFT operation.  A causal Hilbert transform will delay the rear channels, so your other filters will need to be delayed by some amount to compensate.

For example, if $ k $ is the group delay of a causal approximation of a Hilbert filter $ H_k[n] $ then you delay must delay the three front channels by $ k $ as well:
$$
C'[n] = (0.3437L_{encoded}[n] + 0.3437R_{encoded}[n]) * \delta[n-k]
$$

In practice, all of the output signals depend on the two input signals.  That is, you take two input channels and produce one output channel five times.  Your JACK pipeline will need to accommodate this.

I think storing e.g. 10 entries in the session with timestamps per user will be enough.

Just don't save the same page in the session twice.

And the condition will check the current timestamp with the saved one and if it is more than e.g. 10 minutes or the user have read/clicked another 10 articles it will allow the update counter php code.

I don't need to have this bulletproof. Just to disable the increment using browser's refresh button. 

So, if he wants to increment the counter he will need to wait ten minutes or read another 10 articles ;)

2570,3223,question and answer 5142,Euclid's Algorithm (Greatest Common Divisor),"According to Donald Knuth in ""The Art Of Computer Programming"", the following is how to find the greatest common divisor of two positive numbers, m and n, using Euclid's Algorithm.


  
  Divide m by n and let r be the remainder.
  If r is 0, n is the answer; if r is not 0, continue to step 3.
  Set m = n and n = r. Go back to step 1.
  


Below is my implementation of this algorithm.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int greatestCommonDivisor(int m, int n)
{
    int r;

    /* Check For Proper Input */
    if((m == 0) || (n == 0))
        return 0;
    else if((m &lt; 0) || (n &lt; 0))
        return -1;

    do
    {
        r = m % n;
        if(r == 0)
            break;
        m = n;
        n = r;
    }
    while(true);

    return n;
}

int main(void)
{
    int num1 = 600, num2 = 120;
    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(num1, num2); 

    printf(""The GCD of %d and %d is %d\n"", num1, num2, gcd);

    getchar();
    return 0;
}


Though it appears to work just fine, it doesn't seem to be as elegant as I'd like, especially in the do-while loop.  Also, the while(true) seems dangerous, though I'm pretty confident that r will be reduced to 0 eventually and we'll break out of the loop.

Do you have any suggestions on either making the code more elegant or robust?
",Fiddling Bits,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/33159,"Unlike Yuushi, I'm not too fond of recursions, at least when they are not really needed. This is one of those cases.

First, the negative input... The greatest common divisor of numbers -8 and -12 is 4, wouldn't you agree? So, instead of

else if((m &lt; 0) || (n &lt; 0))
    return -1;


I'd put

if (m &lt; 0) m = -m;
if (n &lt; 0) n = -n;


to ensure that both of the numbers are nonnegative. Btw, else rarely (if ever) makes sense after return.

Second, I think that breaking the loop

if (r == 0)
    break;


is misguiding, because what you really want to do is stop the function and return the result. In other words,

if (r == 0) return n;


Third, since your loop is technically infinite, then do { ... } while(true); is equivalent to while (1) { ... }. Personally, I find the latter to be more readable.

Lastly, true does not exist in standard C. If you really want to use it, then include stdbool.h. This belongs to the C99 standard (so, it doesn't work in C89/C90). Personally, I prefer 1 and 0, but this is probably a matter of habit.

2602,3260,question and answer 5198,Is it possible to encrypt a file so that it can not be brute forced?,"Is there any program or method that allows encryption that can not be brute forced or is it just that any encrypted file can be decrypted by brute force?
",user43351,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/43351,"The difficulty of brute forcing an encryption system is based on the degree of randomness produced by the key.  When a key is less than the length of a file, there has to be some type of reuse, and this means less than perfect randomness and thus some small susceptibility to being brute forced.

Thus, in order to make something truly brute force proof against an attacker with unlimited resources and time, the only option is a truly random key that is the same length as the input and that has never been used as a key on another message.  This technique is actually very, very old and is known as a one time pad (or OTP).  An OTP is completely future secure as long as the key remains secret.  Since the key is random and only used once, the input bears no resemblance to the output and ""jfeidj"" could just as easily be ""attack"" as it could be ""dinner"".

That said, attackers don't have unlimited time or resources, so practically speaking, almost any modern symmetric algorithm will provide more than enough security even at key lengths as low as 128 bits or lower.  128 bit AES, for example, while ""technically"" able to be brute forced would take so long trying to brute force that chances are good that if every computer on the planet worked on nothing but cracking the message, the sun would die and the solar system get sucked in to a black hole before they finished cracking the message.  (Provided there aren't any unknown flaws in the algorithm and that the key is properly generated.)  If you make it 256bit, the heat death of the universe will come before you successfully brute force it.

So practically speaking, just about any modern algorithm is secure against brute forcing with sufficient key length.

2608,3266,question and answer 5204,Best way to organize models with multiple meshes and textures?,"I have character models which have different parts, ex: upper body, head, lower body; each part is a separate mesh in the same model. Each part has several textures associated with it (diffuse, normal, etc).

I'm wondering if there is a best practice for associating the textures with the meshes, given a .obj file as the model, for example, and .tga files for the textures.

So for instance, making sure the head textures get mapped on to the head object.

One way would be having a separate file for each mesh, and using the file names to associate them with their textures, but that seems impractical.

Is there a nice, clean way to do this, which is both easy to program (importing and rendering) and easy for the artist?
",cloudhead,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/8899,"Many typical source formats already do what you're asking for in data.  The format will contain a list of N materials and a list of M meshes with a mapping for each particular mesh to the material it uses.  Your converter can convert these directly to your in-engine format.

Other formats make use of external references, which is handy if you have multiple meshes that share materials.  The format is again usually the same: the format has a list of N material references and M meshes and maps each mesh to its material.

In engine, you would either use a reference/pointer/handle to each material for each mesh or use an ID system.  You load your optimized format which would likely use a reference system as in the previous paragraph.  When you load foo.model you'd get a hierarchy of M meshes each with an identiier of the material resource to load.  You load the material if not already loaded and attach the handle/id to the mesh.

For example, you might have the files:

/asset/material/stone.mat
/asset/material/steel.mat
/asset/model/gargoyle.model
/asset/model/gargoyle/face.mat
/asset/model/rock.model
/asset/model/sword.model


In such a setup, your gargoyle.mod might have 4 sub meshes using 3 materials, something like:

body =&gt; /asset/material/stone.mat
sword =&gt; /asset/material/steel.mat
armor =&gt; /asset/material/steel.mat
head =&gt; /asset/model/gargoyle/face.mat


This maps to a structure like:

materials: [0:stone, 1:steel, 2:face]
meshes: [0:(body, 0), 1:(sword, 1), 2:(armor, 1), 3:(head, 2)]


Your engine basically loads that data, loading any materials referenced that's it's missing.  Assuming you've already loaded a number of materials, the in-memory format would be similar to the above but with different IDs (mapping to in-memory structures and not the on-file structure):

materials: [..., 25:stone, ..., 57:steel, ..., 93:face, ...]
models: [..., gargoyle: [0:(body, 25), 1:(sword, 57), 2:(armor, 57), 3:(face, 93)], ...]


A library like Open Asset Importer makes writing your converters much easier given all the formats it supports.  You may need to modify it or branch out if your source format extensions (3d authoring plugins) get too advanced, though it does have a degree of flexibility.

2626,3289,question and answer 5243,"Is there a ""covariant derivative"" for conformal transformation?","A primary field is defined by its behavior under a conformal transformation $x\rightarrow x'(x)$:
$$\phi(x)\rightarrow\phi'(x')=\left|\frac{\partial x'}{\partial x}\right|^{-h}\phi(x)$$

It's fairly easy to see that the gradient of the field doesn't have this nice property under the same transformation, it gets a non homogeneous term. Still, is it possible to construct a derivative that would behave nicely under conformal mappings and give the usual derivative for Lorentz transformations? By adding a ""connection"" similarly as what is done in general relativity or gauge theories. And if not, why?
",Learning is a mess,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/16890,"I) Here we discuss the problem of defining a connection on a conformal manifold $M$. We start with a conformal class $[g_{\mu\nu}]$ of globally$^{1}$ defined metrics 

$$\tag{1} g^{\prime}_{\mu\nu}~=~\Omega^2 g_{\mu\nu}$$

given by Weyl transformations/rescalings. Under mild assumption about the manifold $M$ (para-compactness), we may assume that there exists a conformal class $[A_{\mu}]$ of globally defined co-vectors/one-forms connected via Weyl transformations as

$$\tag{2} A^{\prime}_{\mu}~=~A_{\mu} + \partial_{\mu}\ln(\Omega^2). $$

In particular it is implicitly understood that a Weyl transformation [of a pair $(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})$ of representatives] act in tandem/is synchronized with the same globally defined function $\Omega$ in eqs. (1) and (2) simultaneously.

II) Besides Weyl transformations, we can act (in the active picture) with diffeomorphisms. Locally, in the passive picture, the pair $(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})$ transforms as covariant tensors

$$ \tag{3} g_{\mu\nu}~=~ \frac{\partial  x^{\prime \rho}}{\partial x^{\mu}} g^{\prime}_{\rho\sigma}\frac{\partial  x^{\prime \sigma}}{\partial x^{\nu}},  $$

$$ \tag{4} A_{\mu}~=~ \frac{\partial  x^{\prime \nu}}{\partial x^{\mu}} A^{\prime}_{\nu}. $$

under general coordinate transformations 

$$ \tag{5} x^{\mu} ~\longrightarrow~ x^{\prime \nu}~= ~f^{\nu}(x). $$

III) We next introduce the unique torsionfree tangent-space Weyl connection $\nabla$ with corresponding Christoffel symbols $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ that covariantly preserves the metric in the following sense:

$$ \tag{6} (\nabla_{\lambda}-A_{\lambda})g_{\mu\nu}~=~0. $$

The Weyl connection $\nabla$ and its Christoffel symbols $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ are independent of the pair $(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})$ of representatives within the conformal class $[(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})]$. (But the construction depends of course on the conformal class $[(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})]$.) In other words, the Weyl Christoffel symbols are invariant under Weyl transformations 

$$ \tag{7} \Gamma^{\prime\lambda}_{\mu\nu}~=~\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}.$$ 

The lowered Weyl Christoffel symbols are uniquely given by

$$ \Gamma_{\lambda,\mu\nu}~=~g_{\lambda\rho}  \Gamma^{\rho}_{\mu\nu} $$
$$ ~=~\frac{1}{2}\left((\partial_{\mu}-A_{\mu})g_{\nu\lambda} +(\partial_{\nu}-A_{\nu})g_{\mu\lambda}-(\partial_{\lambda}-A_{\lambda})g_{\mu\nu} \right) $$
$$\tag{8} ~=~\Gamma^{(g)}_{\lambda,\mu\nu}+\frac{1}{2}\left(A_{\mu}g_{\nu\lambda}-A_{\nu}g_{\mu\lambda}+A_{\lambda}g_{\mu\nu} \right), $$

where $\Gamma^{(g)}_{\lambda,\mu\nu}$ denote the lowered Levi-Civita Christoffel symbols for the representative $g_{\mu\nu}$. 
The lowered Weyl Christoffel symbols $\Gamma_{\lambda,\mu\nu}$ scale under Weyl transformations as

$$ \tag{9} \Gamma^{\prime}_{\lambda,\mu\nu}~=~\Omega^2\Gamma_{\lambda,\mu\nu}.$$ 

The corresponding determinant bundle has a Weyl connection given by

$$ \tag{10} \Gamma_{\lambda}~=~\Gamma^{\mu}_{\lambda\mu}~=~(\partial_{\lambda}-A_{\lambda})\ln \sqrt{\det(g_{\mu\nu})}.$$

IV) Let us next define a conformal class $[\rho]$ of a density $\rho$ of weights $(w,h)$, who scales under Weyl transformations as

$$  \tag{11} \rho^{\prime}~=~ \Omega^w\rho $$

with Weyl weight $w$, and as a density

$$\tag{12} \rho^{\prime}~=~\frac{\rho}{J^h}$$

of weight $h$ under general coordinate transformations (5). Here

$$\tag{13} J ~:=~\det(\frac{\partial x^{\prime \nu}}{\partial x^{\mu}}) $$

is the Jacobian. 

Example: The determinant $\det(g_{\mu\nu})$ is a density with $h=2$ and $w=2d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the manifold $M$.

V) The concept of (conformal classes of) densities $\rho$ of weights $(w,h)$ can be generalized to (conformal classes of) tensor densities $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$ of weights $(w,h)$ in a straightforward manner. For instance, a vector density  of weights $(w,h)$ transforms as

$$ \tag{14} \xi^{\prime \mu}~=~ \frac{1}{J^h}\frac{\partial  x^{\prime \mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}} \xi^{\nu} $$

under general coordinate transformations (5), and scales as 

$$ \tag{15} \xi^{\prime \mu}~=~\Omega^w \xi^{\mu} $$

under Weyl transformations. Similarly, a co-vector density of weights $(w,h)$ transforms as

$$ \tag{16} \eta^{\prime}_{\mu}~=~ \frac{1}{J^h}\frac{\partial x^{\nu}}{\partial  x^{\prime \mu}} \eta_{\nu} $$

under general coordinate transformations (5), and scales as 

$$ \tag{17} \eta^{\prime}_{\mu}~=~\Omega^w \eta_{\mu} $$

under Weyl transformations. And so forth for arbitrary tensor densities $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$.

Example: The metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ is a tensor density with $h=0$ and $w=2$. The one-form $A_{\mu}$ is not a tensor density, cf. eq. (2). 

VI) Finally, one can discuss the definition of covariantly conserved (conformal classes of) tensor densities $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$. A density $\rho$ of weights $(w,h)$ is covariantly conserved if

$$\tag{18} (\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\rho~\equiv~ (\partial_{\lambda}-h \Gamma_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\rho~=~0. $$

A vector density of weights $(w,h)$ is covariantly conserved if

$$\tag{19}  (\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\xi^{\mu}~\equiv~ (\partial_{\lambda}-h \Gamma_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\xi^{\mu}+\Gamma_{\lambda\nu}^{\mu}\xi^{\nu} ~=~0. $$

A co-vector density of weights $(w,h)$ is covariantly conserved if

$$\tag{20}(\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\eta_{\mu}~\equiv~  (\partial_{\lambda}-h \Gamma_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\eta_{\mu}-\Gamma_{\lambda\mu}^{\nu}\eta_{\nu} ~=~0. $$

In particular, if $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$ is a tensor density of weights $(w,h)$, then the covariant derivative $(\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$ is also a tensor density of weights $(w,h)$.

2640,3305,question and answer 5272,E_COMPILE_ERROR when enabling Magento compilation,"I'm trying to enable compilation on Magento via the control panel and while compilation is enabled the main page fails to display properly and I find that index.php has repeatedly raised the following error in logs:

",David Perry,https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/2075,"It sounds like one of your extensions, or some custom code in your system, is incompatible with Magento's compilation mode.  The exact solution will vary depending on your PHP system.  Here's an explanation of the problem and some troubleshooting tips that should help you.

A file in your system contains a line that looks something like this

//the string 'ConfigFileManager-Model.php' may be 
//a constant or variable as well

require_once 'ConfigFileManager-Model.php';


The file ConfigFileManager-Model.php is not part of Magento, or any publicly distributed package as far as I can tell.    

It sounds like when you're running in ""non-compiled mode"", Magento can find this file without issue.  That means it's somewhere in the normal Magento include paths

/path/to/magento/app/code/core/ConfigFileManager-Model.php    
/path/to/magento/app/code/community/ConfigFileManager-Model.php
/path/to/magento/app/code/local/ConfigFileManager-Model.php
/path/to/magento/path/to/calling/files/own/folder/ConfigFileManager-Model.php

#possibly more, depending on your system's default include path


However, when Magento runs in compiled mode, the core, local, and community code pool paths are not added as include paths.  Only the folder

/path/to/magento/includes/src


is added as an include path.  Additionally, what compilation mode does is make copies of all the class files and drops them into the includes/src folder.  That means the file's own original folder is no longer in the include path.  Because of this, when Magento runs the require code in compilation mode, it can't find the ConfigFileManager-Model.php file, and fails.

The best thing to do would be recode the module and/or custom code such that the functionality of ConfigFileManager-Model.php is incorporated into a standard Magento helper of model class.

The less good, but quicker thing would be to identify all the places ConfigFileManager-Model.php is required and change the path so it's absolute instead of relative.

2656,3327,question and answer 5310,Covariance and Contravariance on the same type argument,"The C# spec states that an argument type cannot be both covariant and contravariant at the same time.

This is apparent when creating a covariant or contravariant interface you decorate your type parameters with ""out"" or ""in"" respectively.  There is not option that allows both at the same time (""outin"").

Is this limitation simply a language specific constraint or are there deeper, more fundamental reasons based in category theory that would make you not want your type to be both covariant and contravariant?

Edit:

My understanding was that arrays were actually both covariant and contravariant.

public class Pet{}
public class Cat : Pet{}
public class Siamese : Cat{}
Cat[] cats = new Cat[10];
Pet[] pets = new Pet[10];
Siamese[] siameseCats = new Siamese[10];

//Cat array is covariant
pets = cats; 
//Cat array is also contravariant since it accepts conversions from wider types
cats = siameseCats; 

",William Edmondson,https://stackoverflow.com/users/96523,"As others have said, it is logically inconsistent for a generic type to be both covariant and contravariant. There are some excellent answers here so far, but let me add two more.

First off, read my article on the subject of variance ""validity"":

http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/12/03/exact-rules-for-variance-validity.aspx

By definition, if a type is ""covariantly valid"" then it is not usable in a contravariant way. If it is ""contravariantly valid"" then it is not usable in a covariant way.  Something that is both covariantly valid and contravariantly valid is not usable in either a covariant or contravariant way. That is, it is invariant.  So, there is the union of covariant and contravariant: their union is invariant.

Second, let's suppose for a moment that you got your wish and that there was a type annotation that worked the way I think you want:

interface IBurger&lt;in and out T&gt; {}


Suppose you have an IBurger&lt;string&gt;.  Because it is covariant, that is convertible to IBurger&lt;object&gt;.  Because it is contravariant, that is in turn convertible to IBurger&lt;Exception&gt;, even though ""string"" and ""Exception"" have nothing whatsoever in common. Basically ""in and out"" means that IBurger&lt;T1&gt; is convertible to any type IBurger&lt;T2&gt; for any two reference types T1 and T2. How is that useful? What would you do with such a feature?  Suppose you have an IBurger&lt;Exception&gt;, but the object is actually an IBurger&lt;string&gt;. What could you do with that, that both takes advantage of the fact that the type argument is Exception, and allows that type argument to be a complete lie, because the ""real"" type argument is an utterly unrelated type?

To answer your follow-up question: implicit reference type conversions involving arrays are covariant; they are not contravariant. Can you explain why you incorrectly believe them to be contravariant?

  Possible Duplicate:
  Why avoid increment (&ldquo;++&rdquo;) and decrement (&ldquo;--&rdquo;) operators in JavaScript?  




I'm a big fan of Douglas Crockford and his excellent book, JavaScript: The Good Parts. I also use his JSLint tool on an hourly basis before checking in any code to our repository, as is good sense.

One thing I've noticed when running code through JSLint is its insistence that the ++ increment operator is somehow evil. I know I can turn certain rules off, but that's cheating ;). Crockford mentions his dislike on page 112 of JS: TGP...


  In my own practice, I observed that when I used ++ and --, my code tended to be too tight, too tricky, too cryptic. So, as a matter of discipline, I don't use them any more. I think that as a result, my coding style has become cleaner.


That's all very lovely, but he doesn't give any examples of the way he codes them now. I assume he's doing something like...

var i;
i = 0;
i = i + 1;


Again, great, but I've got a few basic 'for loops' in my JS code, as I imagine many people have, and I've always used the standard syntax...

for (i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) { 
    // Loop Stuff

",Fabian Schmengler,https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/243,"Actually it's possible with a URL parameter ?active_tab=$id.

How to find the right tab id

Find the responsible tab container class. This is a child class of Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Tabs, in my case, Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Catalog_Product_Attribute_Edit_Tabs.

You'll find calls to $this-&gt;addTab(), usually in the methods _beforeToHtml(), or _construct(). The first parameter of addTab() is the tab id:

$this-&gt;addTab('labels', array(
    'label'     =&gt; Mage::helper('catalog')-&gt;__('Manage Label / Options'),
    'title'     =&gt; Mage::helper('catalog')-&gt;__('Manage Label / Options'),
    'content'   =&gt; $this-&gt;getLayout()-&gt;createBlock('adminhtml/catalog_product_attribute_edit_tab_options')-&gt;toHtml(),
));


So, the URL is /admin/catalog_product_attribute/edit/attribute_id/123/?active_tab=labels, generated with this code (within an adminhtml block):

$this-&gt;getUrl('adminhtml/catalog_product_attribute/edit',
    array('attribute_id' =&gt; 123, '_query' =&gt; array('active_tab' =&gt; 'labels'));




How it works

Let's have a look at the responsible code:

Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Tabs::_beforeToHtml()

Sets the active tab based on URL parameter or session value. If setActiveTab() is not called, the _activeTab property defaults to the first added tab:

    if ($activeTab = $this-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;getParam('active_tab')) {
        $this-&gt;setActiveTab($activeTab);
    } elseif ($activeTabId = Mage::getSingleton('admin/session')-&gt;getActiveTabId()) {
        $this-&gt;_setActiveTab($activeTabId);
    }


app/design/adminhtml/default/default/template/widget/tabs.phtml

Here, the result of getActiveTabId() is passed to the varienTabs instantiation in JavaScript:

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    &lt;?php echo $this-&gt;getJsObjectName() ?&gt; = new varienTabs(
        '&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;getId() ?&gt;',
        '&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;getDestElementId() ?&gt;',
        '&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;getActiveTabId() ?&gt;',
        &lt;?php echo $this-&gt;getAllShadowTabs()?&gt;);

How do we go about transferring it to the business, in order to account for it as a business expense?
",Brian David Berman,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/1886,"I'd approach the lender that you're getting the lease from, but be prepared for them either saying 'no' to putting the lease into the name of an LLC without any proven track record (because it hasn't been around for a while) or require you to sign a personal guarantee, which partially defeats the purpose of putting the car lease into the LLC.

I'd also talk to an accountant to see if you can't just charge the business the mileage on your vehicle as that might be the simplest solution, especially if the lender gets stroppy. Of course the mileage rate might not cover the expense for the lease as that one is designed to cover the steepest part of the depreciation curve.

Does your LLC generate the revenue needed so it can take on the lease in the first place? If it's a new business you might not need or want the drain on your finances that a lease can be.

2724,3409,question and answer 5431,Need help using vba to fill in blanks left by excel pivot table when using %difference from previous row,"So, I'm not very knowledgeable at all yet when it comes to VBA. I have experience with Java, so I understand the concepts of structure behind coding and can read/understand basic-intermediate code. But when it comes to writing it myself, I'm definitely still a 1.5 out of 10 in terms of writing VBA myself. So, any help would be greatly appreciated.

So I have the following example pivot table (my actual is about 10 years of data with a few more columns):


The red and yellow dots are my problem areas. The columns with blank titles are just %differences from the previous row. However, as you can see, using that leaves blank spaces for the first month of every year (those are the yellow dots). Also, for the year lines, it doesn't calculate the %difference from the previous year (the red dots).

So, what I'm needing is (most likely) a PivotTableUpdate or PivotTableChangeSync (I still don't understand the difference actually by the way) to fill in data in those cells with the red and yellow dots. Any thoughts?

On the PivotTable you add NP and Test2 to the section of values, then you can use Max or Sum for Test2 and it will look like this:

2736,3425,question and answer 5450,Is there added value in having your own presentation layout and using it consistently?,"From the perspective of a Ph.D. student, how much of an added value is it to have your own presentation slides layout, that is used consistently throughout your Ph.D. conference presentations and other talks (and possibly throughout your academic career afterwards)?

Here is one such example from the Computer Science community.

This as as opposed to using existing Beamer templates with LaTeX, or built-in PowerPoint templates, or simply preparing each presentation on its own (without a specific layout).

A couple of axes I can think along:


Creating a signature layout that distinguishes one in their community
Ease of preparation of presentations (especially over time), maybe overcoming constraints with existing templates.


Note that I am not concerned with the question of content, but just design and layout.
",lyes,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/15902,"Standardising layouts have three advantages:


You can reuse slides across presentation without changing the styling.  
When you create presentations, you don't need to think about styling; the templates are already set up for you.
Creating templates and styling can be delegated to someone with design skills, and everyone else gets to use them.


The first two points are applicable whether you have your own signature style, or you follow a team or corporate style.

The last point is different. In theory, having a corporate style is a really good idea because everyone gets the benefit of using templates created by the design genius in the marketing department.  In practice, corporate templates are almost universally awful.

So, if a corporate template exists, and you are lucky enough to like it, then use that.  There's no point in reinventing the wheel.

If there is no template, or it is dreadful, then create one for yourself and stick to that.  

Either way, you don't want to have to keep deciding on new fonts to use for every presentation that you make.

So what is the purpose of passive and active as by two different names?
",john michal,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/4123,"The sentence may recount the same facts, or it may not. One very significant difference is that in the active voice you must identify the Agent: the person (or other entity) who  performs the action, whereas in the passive you are free to omit the Agent.

Active


  ok John stole my book.
  &lowast;&nbsp; Stole my book. 


Passive


  ok My book was stolen by John.
  ok My book was stolen.  


In either case, the passive voice is employed to focus on the Patient of the action&mdash;the person or thing which 'suffered' it&mdash;rather than on Agent who or which performed it. There are several reasons you might want to do this:


Because you don&rsquo;t know or don&rsquo;t care who performed the action  
Because what is important is the action itself rather than who performed it
Because what is important is the result of the action rather than who performed it 
Because you want your readers to think of the action as 'impersonal'  


The last reason became particularly important in the 19th century, when scientific writers&mdash;or writers who wanted to be thought of as adopting a 'scientific' attitude&mdash;were particularly careful to banish any suggestion that the writer's personality or attitudes had any influence on what was reported. The passive voice remains to this day something of a fetish in the sciences, particularly in the 'soft' sciences, where there is still substantial anxiety about the scientific status and value of the work done.

The show PDF button listener below shows the String 'pdffilename' gets assigned the String contained in the 'mFilename' EditText field. The PdfViewerActivity is started and the String 'pdffilename' is passed as an Extra. In the onCreate() the intent is checked if null or not. This is where I think the change can/should be made.

2758,3452,question and answer 5493,Are programming books in other languages useful for Python?,"I'm a self-taught intermediate Python programmer; I frequently come across popular books on software development and programming written in other languages (often Java). 

Typical examples:


Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code
Design Patterns, Gang of Four
Test Driven Development: By Example
The Art of Unit Testing: With Examples in .NET


Generally speaking, how useful is it to read a book written for another language? Specifically, what about Python? Should one stick to language specific books? 

For example, a lot of people praise Design Patterns by the GOF, I've never read it because the model applies to other languages (after all Python is about anti-patterns, right?) yet I feel the urge to because of it's place in the CS literature cannon. 

Likewise, would The Art of Unit Testing: With Examples in .NET help a Python programmer learn unit testing even though the examples are in .Net? 
",Jason Wirth,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/21104,"First of all, some of the books you mentioned are written with examples in multiple programming languages. For example, GOF's DP is written with C++ and, if fewer, Smalltalk examples, and TDD is written with Java and Python examples.

If you are well trained in picking up what's useful, dropping what's not, and translating what you've picked up, you'll benefit from reading most of generally recommended books for programmers. However, if you have little experience in doing this, you could start from ""near-transfer"" books. Otherwise, you will learn very little, or even you will learn bad ideas and habits -- some of the practices are language-paradigm dependent. I have seen a good deal of Python programmers with all the hassles for implementing GOF's DP in C++.

Transfer is psychological and educational term for applying what you have learned in a different context. They differentiate between near and far transfer. Usually near-transfer is easier and more effective, which means you need to put more effort for far-transfer.

For near-transfer learning, I highly recommend learning from similar languages, in terms of its paradigm, to your target language -- siblings in the language typology. For Python, that would be something like Smalltalk -- or nowadays Ruby but Smalltalk's legacy is greater.

For instance, you will learn a lot more from reading DPSC than from solely reading GOF's DP. (BTW, reading both DPSC and GOF's DP at the same time with careful contrasting and comparing is a very rewarding learning experience)

From my near-transfer experiences, I remember leaps of improvement in my Python programming from reading books(articles, papers, and etc) for Smalltalk, APL, Io, and ICON, all of which are dynamic in nature.

2776,3473,question and answer 5538,What are the relativistic effects of expanding spacetime?,"This is a question I've been mulling over for a while and I'm hoping someone here can point me in the right direction. Sorry if it's a bit of a novice question. For the record, I don't fully know GR, but don't let that stop you from using it in the answer.

Since the universe is expanding - that is, the spacetime metric is expanding by way of a near-exponentially increasing scale factor - we can say that the distance between any two non-bound objects is increasing over time. Herein lays my dilemma; if there were two objects separated by a large distance that had no relative velocities initially, after a long time, the effects of expansion would cause them to have large apparent velocities away from each other. Given that there hasn't been any acceleration to cause these velocities, are there still relativistic effects in play? That is, is there time dilation between the two frames?

Furthermore, given long enough time, the rate of increasing distance between the two objects could place them outside of their visible horizon (ie they are travelling away from each other at superluminal velocities). Since there was still no acceleration to achieve this feat, what can one say about the relativistic effects in this case?

At first I thought this was an easy question. I thought of course there would be relativistic effects and when the objects go superluminal, the visible horizon is there to ensure there can never be causal contact and thus preserve physics. But then I thought what if spacetime stopped expanding abruptly (seems crazy but as far as I know, nothing makes this completely impossible)? Since there was no initial relative velocities, wouldn't the two objects return to being in the same inertial frame? And seeing as none of them experienced any sort of acceleration, how then could we describe their two final states? By which I mean, if we were to assume there were relativistic effects during transit, how would we overcome such simple paradoxes like the twin paradox, or other relevant ones?

At this point, I'm stumped. I even attended a lecture by Miguel Alcubierre since he would have had to consider these types of effects in his design... No help. Equations are great to illustrate a point, but I'm really going to need a conceptual answer as well to fully understand this.
",Jack Dozer,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/23898,"
  Given that there hasn't been any acceleration to cause these velocities, [...]


As a side issue, even in Newtonian mechanics, accelerations don't cause velocities. Accelerations are just a measure of how rapidly velocities are changing.

What you're running into here is the fact that general relativity doesn't have any notion of how to measure the motion of object A relative to a distant object B. It is neither true nor false that A and B gain relative velocity due to cosmological expansion. It is neither true nor false that A and B have nonzero accelerations relative to one another. Frames of reference in GR are local, not global. It's valid to say that distant galaxies are moving away from us at some velocity. It's also valid to say that everything is standing still, but the space between us and the distant galaxy is expanding.


  [...] are there still relativistic effects in play? That is, is there time dilation between the two frames?


Kinematic time dilation is well defined in SR, which means that in GR it's only defined locally. Gravitational time dilation is only well defined in GR in the case of a static spacetime, but cosmological spacetimes aren't static. So it is neither true nor false that there is time dilation between us and a distant galaxy. Concretely, you could measure Doppler shifts. If you feel like interpreting these shifts in purely kinematic terms, you can assign a velocity to the distant galaxy relative to us. But this is not mandatory and actually doesn't really work very well, in the sense that the velocity you get is usually several times smaller than the rate at which the proper distance between the galaxies is increasing. (Proper distance is defined as the distance you would measure with a chain of rulers, each at rest relative to the CMB, at a moment in time defined according to a notion of simultaneity defined by cosmological conditions such as the temperature of the CMB.) In particular, there are galaxies that we can observe that are now and always have been receding from us at $v&gt;c$, if you define $v$ as the rate of change of proper distance. The fact that we can observe them tells us that their Doppler shifts are finite and correspond to $v&lt;c$.

So I need to build a switching circuit that will provide the 12 volt signals to the cruise kit.  I was thinking of keeping it solid-state, since I don't know of any relays that will switch on 2-3 volts.  However, if there's a good reason to use relays then I can.

",jnylen,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/1610,"Airbag requires about 6V only to set it off, so setting 5V as your ceiling is probably pushing it, I think I remember it needed less than 200mA, so a fuse is actually a waste of time, if not a bad placebo.

The trouble with relays or switches, is that they need to have a good bit of juice running through the contacts, else they do not make good contact (they are designed to actually arc, and in low current applications, a small ceramic is used to sometimes make a tiny spark to weld the contacts together). DC is also not that great, since the arc carries metal with it. 

So a transistor switching (boosting) circuit (which you have designed) is also getting my vote, you can use the transistors to drive a 12V relay (small one), ro regulators needed, and since car battery is 13.5V and the darlington-style circuit (which you drew) often looses just over a volt anyway.

",Samaursa,https://stackoverflow.com/users/368599,"difference_type usually denotes the type suitable to denote a distance in an array or similar. The following wording is from the allocator requirements, but whenever the standard talks about difference_type it means the same concept:


  a type that can represent the difference between any two pointers in
  the allocation model


The natural type for this is ptrdiff_t.

For the size_type it says:


  a type that can represent the size of the largest object in the
  allocation model.


The natural type here is size_t.

Now for the count of any elements in a range (or an array) does need at least the type suitable to specify the difference last-first. It seems most natural to chose that one.

I seem to have hazy memories that a Wild Cantor didn't interact particularly well with cards with Convoke, so I was wondering if it was a similar story here...
",thesunneversets,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/436,"From my interpretation, it should work.


  601 Casting Spells
  
  601.2e The player determines the total cost of the spell. Usually this is just the mana cost. Some spells have additional or alternative costs. Some effects may increase or reduce the cost to pay, or may provide other alternative costs. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. The total cost is the mana cost or alternative cost (as determined in rule 601.2b), plus all additional costs and cost increases, and minus all cost reductions. If the mana component of the total cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it is considered to be {0}. It can't be reduced to less than {0}. Once the total cost is determined, any effects that directly affect the total cost are applied. Then the resulting total cost becomes ""locked in."" If effects would change the total cost after this time, they have no effect.
  
  601.2f If the total cost includes a mana payment, the player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see rule 605, ""Mana Abilities""). Mana abilities must be activated before costs are paid.
  
  Example: You cast Altar's Reap, which costs {1}{B} and has an additional cost of sacrificing a creature. You sacrifice Thunderscape Familiar, whose effect makes your black spells cost {1} less to cast. Because a spell's total cost is ""locked in"" before payments are actually made, you pay {B}, not {1}{B}, even though you're sacrificing the Familiar.


So first you determine and lock the mana cost, then you can activate mana abilities, then you have to pay the mana cost.

As for the definition of a Mana Ability:


  
  Mana Abilities
  
  
  605.1a An activated ability is a mana ability if it meets three criteria: it doesn't have a target, it could put mana into a player's mana pool when it resolves, and it's not a loyalty ability. (See rule 606, ""Loyalty Abilities."")


The cantor meets all 3 criteria, so its ability is a mana ability. Therefore, you should gain both the cost reduction and the mana through saccing.

As for why a cantor should not play nicely with Convoke, I don't know - do you have an authoritative source that it really doesn't work? ""Tapping a creature"" is an optional, additional cost by Convoke, and after tapping for convoke you should still be able to sac the Cantor with its mana ability.

Here is an explanation why the cantor can only reduce convoke spells by 1. However, that does not affect my answer to your actual question. The subtle difference between the two is that Blasphemous Act has a cost reduction, which is locked after you determined it. Convoke, OTOH, offers an alternative way of paying the mana costs and requires you to tap creatures to pay for its cost. You can announce to tap the cantor, but once you sacced it for mana, you can of course no longer do so, and the game rewinds to before you announced Blasphemous Act.

Also, if you're connecting remotely, you probably are running a VPN connection, which takes it's own connection overhead with encryption other protocol requirements.

If you need to transfer a large file between these machines, you'll probably get a much better throughput installing Dropbox on both of them and syncing files that way.

",user275846,https://askubuntu.com/users/275846,"Okay I got build errors. Haven't got time to test it at the moment :(.

Also: ""After this operation, 1779 MB of additional disk space will be used.""
So make sure you have a few GB's set aside if you're going to do this.



Okay so I got it working by following this: How to install the Pantheon desktop environment? Basically the PPA everyone is suggesting works, is 404-ing for me (and presumably you) when I try and access it.

1) This is syslinux-themes-elementary-isis, and the .sh script apparently requires it. Sudo apt-get didn't find it for me. You could probably test removing this dependency from the .sh if you are feeling bold. I installed amd64 version of this (as I am on 64 bit, if you are on 32 bit obviously don't), just use a .deb installer on Ubuntu:

https://launchpad.net/~elementary-os/+archive/daily/+files/syslinux-themes-elementary-isis_2-0%7E4%7Esaucy1_amd64.deb


2) This is required by the elementary os install script:

sudo apt-get install dctrl-tools dpkg-dev 
    genisoimage gfxboot-theme-ubuntu live-build squashfs-tools syslinux zsync


3) The script uses this to determine what files to download (obviously don't do both, amd64 is for 64bit and i386 is for 32 bit) (you'll want to put this in .bashrc or somewhere else for it to be permanent, not 100% anyone will ever need this again though):

export ARCH=amd64
export ARCH=i386


4) From the previous question/answer thread:

sudo apt-get install bzr
bzr branch lp:elementaryos
cd elementaryos
sudo congrego.sh


On my machine I didn't specify $ARCH so I got 90% of the way through a 970 M .iso file for i386 before I realised -_-.

Currently running through the amd64 installation.



As an aside:

# load config
source etc/congrego.conf

if [[ ""$ARCH"" == ""all"" ]]; then
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/download.sh i386
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/download.sh amd64
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/build.sh i386
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/build.sh amd64
        if [[ ""$SOURCEFORGE"" != """" ]]; then
            $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/sourceforge.sh i386
            $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/sourceforge.sh amd64
        fi
else
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/download.sh ""$ARCH""
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/build.sh ""$ARCH""
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/sourceforge.sh ""$ARCH""
fi


It is a bit presumptuous that users would have that environment variable set. Unless I am reading it wrong, it seems like it will download iso's for i386 AND amd64 and then build both of them, which sounds like a bad idea. I'm noob at bash script though so it could be fine for all I know.

Just in case this is irrelevant to your machine:

There is no closed form expression for this. However, a more realistic goal is to have the ability to find the next larger element, $a_{n+1},$ in the list up to element $n,$ then the next one after that, and so on. This has been done. For general terminology, you want On Highly Composite Numbers by Jean-Louis Nicolas, pages 215-244 in a book called Ramanujan Revisited, edited by George Andrews et al, appearing in 1988. You may email me for a pdf. Then, the specific method is by his student Guy Robin, Methodes d'optimisation pour un probleme de theorie des nombres, R.A.I.R.O. Informatique theoretique 17, no. 3, 1983, pages 239-247.

The reason it is possible to do such a thing is that highly composite numbers bear some resemblance to superior highly composite numbers. S.H.C. numbers have the basic feature, nonincreasing exponents, but in addition the ratios of the exponents for distinct primes $p \neq q$ must approximate the outcome of Ramanujan's recipe.  Between consecutive S.H.C. numbers, one may find all the h.c. numbers as a sort of operations research problem. This is all, well, difficult. So it all depends on why this is important to you, and how important. The short version, meanwhile, is that you calculate the s.h.c larger than you current $a_n,$ calculate the h.c. numbers up that high, and take the smallest one that is a multiple of $a_n.$ If you need to go up an extra s.h.c number, so be it.

Note that finding the first s.h.c number which is a multiple of your fixed number $a_n$ is entirely straightforward, as for any given $p^e,$ one may find the first (largest) $\delta &gt; 0$ such that the s.h.c. number $N_\delta$ is divisible by $p^e.$ Do this for all primes that divide your fixed $a_n$ and there you have it.

Proof. Consider any two points $u,v$ in $\mathbb{R}^2-A$. There is a foliation of continuum many paths from $u$ to $v$, which are disjoint except at $u$ and $v$. For example, one could consider all the various circle fragments containing $u$ and $v$.

On different computer builds, ASUS/GIGABYTE/MSI, I constantly have outgoing connections to XXX-XXX-XXX.deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com over HTTP Port 80, and if the connection attempts are denied, the network card (or at least internet connectivity) stops working... LAN connections still appear to work. The outgoing connections occur on every restart, and must be allowed for the network card to function properly. If the attempts are denied, the system must be restated so that the connections will be attempted again and can be allowed.

2887,3612,question and answer 5767,"Replicate a big, dense Windows volume over a WAN -- too big for DFS-R","I've got a server with a LOT of small files -- many millions files, and over 1.5 TB of data. I need a decent backup strategy.


Any filesystem-based backup takes too long -- just enumerating which files need to be copied takes a day. 
Acronis can do a disk image in 24 hours, but fails when it tries to do a differential backup the next day. 
DFS-R won't replicate a volume with this many files.


I'm starting to look at Double Take, which seems to be able to do continuous replication. Are there other solutions that can do continuous replication at a block or sector level -- not file-by-file over a WAN?

Some details:


The files are split up into about 75,000 directories.
99% of the daily change comes from adding new directories; existing files are rarely changed.


There's some other relevant discussion here.

2890,3616,question and answer 5774,Should I have one unified design between mobile and desktop?,"With a website I'm building, I'm wondering if I should combine the experiences between platforms together. For example, I'm wondering if I should keep this for both mobile and desktop. Here are some examples




I'm mainly wondering about the header. Is it bad to keep a more mobile like design (meaning slide menus, e.t.c.) on desktop, or should I utilize more of the space that mobile would not have?
",Tinfoilboy,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/47826,"First off all, I appreciate that you seem to design your responsive web with a mobile-first approach (that's how I perceive it anyway).

As Imperative has already stated, consistency is generally a good thing. However, the mobile-sized interface might still be come through as consistent with the desktop-sized ditto even though they don't share the exact same navigation pattern. For instance branding elements, graphical profile, copy, artwork and information architecture might keep it together just fine. Especially important is that the IA is, at least, very similar for the users to find their way around the site. When the content is grouped and structured the same way, a user that is familiar with one of the platforms but new to the second will know what to look for and have a hunch of how too, which helps a lot. 

The off-canvas drawer menu is (obviously) a solution that partially solves a common mobile interface problem: the deficit of real estate. But that's a problem that rarely applies when it comes to desktop interfaces. Consistency is valuable, but should you be consistent between your own interfaces, or with the standards for the respective platforms they're being used in?

Off-canvas drawer for mobile:  


Access to all top level navigation items in one place 
Robust in a sense that new items can be added in infinity (can be a curse too:)
Menu button is in a convenient position (even though it's usually in the ""hard"" corner)


Off-canvas for desktop: 


I guess Fitt's law still applies, and the expedition up the north-western corner of the screen can actually be quite long. A drop in efficiency?
You don't always want to fill the entire width with content as the user can use a very wide screen on a PC, which can make the positioning of the menu and its button really awkward, and actually even hard to see. 
A button in the corner can interfere with hot corners, or rather, the other way around. 
An extra click, that could have been avoided, is added to reach a menu item.
The menu items are obscured until the user has visited the menu, when they could have been displayed directly. 


Based on the arguments above, I would recommend a different pattern than the drawer menu for the desktop site.

Here's your original code:

add_filter( 'the_title', 'remove_page_title' );

function remove_page_title() {
   if(is_page('138')) {
   }
   return '';
}


What it's doing is adding a filter on the_title that doesn't accept any parameters.  That's your first mistake.  The the_title filter actually takes two parameters - the page/post title and the page/post id.  So first, let's rewrite our hook:

add_filter( 'the_title', 'remove_page_title', 10, 2 );
function remove_page_title( $title, $id ) {

}


This assigns our filter with a priority of 10 and lets us accept both parameters sent in by the filter.  Then we specify the parameters our function accepts.

Inside the function, we want to check if we're on the right page.  If we are, return '', if we aren't return the title:

if( '138' == $id ) return '';

return $title;


Your original function was always returning '' when the filter ran.  That's why you were getting a blank title on every page, not just the page you wanted.

Our full code

So your full filter, rewritten to accept parameters and use the proper logic:

add_filter( 'the_title', 'remove_page_title', 10, 2 );

function remove_page_title( $title, $id ) {
    if( '138' == $id ) return '';

If you are getting the insurance from the rental car company (CDP/LDW/etc) then they will not vary it depending on the type of license you have.  If you are getting it via travel insurance or credit card insurance then again it will not vary based on your license - but be sure to read the fine print to make sure it's covered!

If you are looking at buying a car, then it will make a difference, but be prepared for a shock either way. Many insurance companies will not offer you insurance if you do not have a US drivers license.  I've been told there are some that will - especially for medium-term tourists - but expect to pay a lot for it.

If you do have a US drivers license then you will be able to get coverage, but it will not be cheap. Every insurance company I've ever looked at will ask you how long you've been licensed in the US, and will penalize you heavily for anything below 18 months/3 years/5 years (depending on the company). Most will also ask how long you've held a license in another country, and may reduce the price slightly due to your overseas license - but it won't be by much.

Plugging your details, along with those of the type of car you might consider buying, into some of the insurance companies websites will probably be very telling for you - both in terms of whether they will allow you to purchase coverage without a US license, and how much they will charge with only 1-2 months license history in the US.

",MOON,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/15207,"From http://www.lonelyplanet.com/antarctica/practical-information/visas:  


  No single government controls Antarctica, so visitors do not need visas to go there. But with the ratification of the Antarctic Treaty’s Protocol on Environmental Protection in 1998, all visitors who are citizens of countries that are signatories of the Antarctic Treaty must have a permit to visit Antarctica. Cruise ship passengers are covered under the permits applied for by the cruise company. Yacht passengers and crew, and anyone visiting Antarctica by air, should check with their national government to make sure they have their paperwork in order. If you are uncertain about your status, check with your tour operator.

",AncientSwordRage,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/3804,"The Marvel Wiki entry on Spider-Man's Web-Shooters says this about the web fluid:


  The web fluid is a shear-thinning liquid (virtually solid until a shearing force is applied to it, rendering it fluid) whose exact formula is as yet unknown, but is related to nylon. On contact with air, the long-chain polymer knits and forms an extremely tough, flexible fiber with extraordinary adhesive properties. The web fluid's adhesive quality diminishes rapidly with exposure to air. (Where it does not make contact with air, such as the attachment disk of the web-shooter, it remains very adhesive.) After about one to two hours, certain imbibed esters cause the solid form of the web fluid to dissolve into a powder. Because the fluid almost instantly sublimates from solid to liquid when under shear pressure, and is not adhesive in its anaerobic liquid/solid phase transition point, there is no clogging of the web-shooter's parts.


The Marvel Directory entry on Spider-Man says that Peter Parker intended to imitate spider's silk.


  Parker used equipment borrowed from his high school to fabricate a fluid that imitated a spider's silk web, and spinneret devices to project that fluid from his wrists in the form of a web strand.

2931,3663,question and answer 5843,House rules to make the cloister less of a game winning tile in Carcassonne?,"In my experience, cloister tiles in Carcassonne are often ""too lucky"". If you draw a cloister tile in the beginning of the game, it will typically still require an investment of quite a bit of ""meeple"" time to obtain the full 9 points, which makes it a fair trade-off. However, after about half of the game, it's relatively likely that you can ""parachute"" a cloister tile in some spot and get 8 or 9 points immediately. This adds a lot of randomness to the game.

What house rules work well to diminish this effect?
",Erik P.,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/30,"You could borrow the ""Abbey"" idea from the Abbyes and Mayors expansion.

Abbeys are special tiles (6 of them divided equally among all players) which you can play rather than drawing and playing a random tile. The abbey counts as a cloister for scoring and playing a meeple on, and has a solid edge, so that it ends a road, and walls off citys and farms that it borders. Abbeys can only be played in holes - spaces that have tiles on all four sides.

The effect of this is that areas that are prime ""gotcha"" cloister locations at end game are a little less likely as they either get Abbeys dropped into them, or players shy away from letting such places appear.

Without Abbeys and Mayors, you could allow each player once or twice a game, the option of playing a tile face down in a whole rather as an Abbey than as a normal play, and otherwise following the normal Abbey rules.

2955,3700,question and answer 5899,Eigenvalues of a transition probability matrix,"I have read that, for
$$I - \alpha P$$
where $I$ is the $n\times n$ identity matrix, $\alpha \in (0,1]$, and $P$ is the transition probability matrix with dimensions $n \times n$, $I - \alpha P$ is an invertible matrix because the eigenvalues of any transition probability matrix lie within the unit circle of the complex plane. ""Thus no eigenvalue of $\alpha P$ can be equal to 1, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for $I - \alpha P$ to be invertible.""

Why is that?
",user243716,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/243716,"As stated, the result is FALSE.  Presuming P is indeed a Markov Chain transition matrix, i.e., is row stochastic, i.e., all entries are non-negative with all row sums equal to 1, then the largest eigenvalue of P is exactly 1. Given that α = 1 satisfies α ∈ (0,1],  I - α * P in this case has an eigenvalue = 0 (i.e., corresponding to P's eigenvalue of 1).  Therefore, such an I - α * P is not invertible; and in this case,  α * P = P, which has largest eigenvalue = 1.  The result would be true if the restriction on α were changed to α ∈(0,1).  

The statement, ""eigenvalues of any transition probability matrix lie within the unit circle of the complex plane"" is true only if ""within"" is interpreted to mean inside or on the boundary of the unit circle, as is the case for the largest eigenvalue, 1.

Proof that P has an eigenvalue = 1.  All row sums of P = 1, therefore,

P  * (vector of ones) = (vector of ones)


Therefore, 1 is an eigenvalue of P with right eigenvector = (vector of ones), thereby establishing the falsehood of the claim made in the opening post of the thread.

2983,3740,question and answer 5957,Structure for nitrate ion?,"

Why is the above structure not considered a valid structure for the nitrate ion? Is it because adding a double bond reduces the formal charges present on the nitrogen? Does the above form exist anywhere?
",1110101001,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/2142,"Nitrate actually exists as a superposition of these three resonance forms:



Essentially, a lone pair from an oxygen with a negative formal change forms a double bond to nitrogen. However, as nitrogen is a period II element, and hence must obey the octet rule, it can not have 5 bonds to other atoms. The already-present double bond then turns into a single bond and the pair of electrons moves onto the oxygen. This ""movement"" can happen with all three of the oxygen atoms and all three of the bonds. This is called ""resonance"".

Due to resonance, the energy of the system is minimised making it more stable.

Your Lewis structure is not far off. The ""true"" structure of nitrate is:



Approximately, each oxygen atom contributes one third of a bond with the nitrogen, lowering the formal charge on each atom from what you have written, which does not exist in nature.

The true structure is sort of an average of the properties of each possibility for where the electrons could be located, including the three resonance forms above, your structure, and any other configuration. However, these other forms are of minuscule probability to be formed (perhaps read up on wavefunctions and electron distributions if you're interested), and so the main contributors to the ""real"" structure are the three resonance forms.

Note that none of these structures ever exist in isolation for more than the most infinitesimal of time periods.

",v_2e,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/16578,"The \biboptions macro would seem to be set up by the elsarticle document class (or one of its subsidiary files), rather than by natbib. If you can use this command to disable sorting/compressing of numerical references, I'd do so.

The commands natbib provides to change citation-related defaults are \setcitestyle and \bibpunct. The \bibpunct command is the older of the two, and always takes exactly six arguments. The command \setcitestyle, in contrast, is more flexible and also a bit ""wordier"". However, neither of these two commands would allow you to undo a package option such as ""sort&amp;compress"".

Finally, I'd say that if you're forced to use a certain document class and bibliography style file for your journal submission, it's generally not productive to try to subvert this requirement. A cover letter, in which you explain to the editor and editorial assistants why one or more settings embedded in their journal's default setup are not chosen optimally and why they should consider accepting a different set of settings, may be the better approach to achieving a satisfactory outcome.

",大易归真,https://askubuntu.com/users/422775,"apt-get update


Refreshes the repositories and fetches information about packages that are available online.

apt-get upgrade


Downloads and installs updates for all installed packages - as long as it doesn't bother dependencies (install new packages, remove old ones or crosses a repo source (switch a package from one repo to another)).

apt-get dist-upgrade


Does the same as ""upgrade"" but upgrades a package also when dependencies or sources are changed (something you want to avoid on servers without further testing).

To conclude - an update can break things but it is necessary!
So if you are on a desktop you should normally do a: 

sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade


Without destroying something.

On a server most of the times a: 

sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade


should be enough AND security updates should be installed automatically (on servers and desktops)

TL;DR!

Yes you should update php in this example - cause it is a security fix (what can be seen through the numbering scheme of php and else it would not have been pushed into the ""upgrade"" branch of ubuntu...

3013,3774,question and answer 6007,Find Nearest Line Segments to Point,"Background

From a known Point, I require to establish the nearest surrounding ""visible perimeter"" against a table of MultiLineStrings, as shown on the diagram.

I've searched this site with a number of terms (e.g. minimum edge, minimum perimeter, nearest neighbour, clip, containing polygon, visibility, snap, cut nodes, ray-trace, flood fill, inner boundary, routing, concave hull) but cannot find any previous question which seems to match this scenario.

Diagram


The green circle is the known Point.
The black lines are the known MultiLineStrings.
The grey lines are an indication of a radial sweep from the known Point.
The red points are the nearest intersection of the radial sweep and the MultiLineStrings.




Parameters


The Point will never intersect the MultiLineStrings.
The Point will always be nominally centred within the MultiLineStrings.
The MultiLineStrings will never fully enclose the Point, therefore the perimeter will be a MultiLineString.
There will be a table containing approximately 1,000 MultiLineStrings (normally containing a single line of about 100 points).


Methodology Considered


Undertake a radial sweep by constructing a series of lines from the known Point (at, say, 1 degree increments).
Establish the nearest intersection point of each radial sweep line with the MultiLineStrings.
When one of the radial sweep lines doesn't intersect with any of the MultiLineStrings, this would indicate a gap in the perimeter which would be accommodated in the perimeter MultiLineString construction.


Summary

Whilst this technique will find the nearest intersections, it won't necessarily find all the closest perimeter node points, dependent on the resolution of the radial sweep. Can anyone recommend an alternative method to establish all the perimeter points or supplement the radial sweep technique with some form of buffering, sectoring or offsetting?

Software

My preference is to use SpatiaLite and/or Shapely for the solution but would welcome any suggestions which could be implemented using open source software.

Edit: Working Solution (based on answer by @gene)

from shapely.geometry import Point, LineString, mapping, shape
from shapely.ops import cascaded_union
from shapely import affinity
import fiona

sweep_res = 10  # sweep resolution (degrees)
focal_pt = Point(0, 0)  # radial sweep centre point
sweep_radius = 100.0  # sweep radius

# create the radial sweep lines
line = LineString([(focal_pt.x,focal_pt.y), \
                   (focal_pt.x, focal_pt.y + sweep_radius)])

sweep_lines = [affinity.rotate(line, i, (focal_pt.x, focal_pt.y)) \
               for i in range(0, 360, sweep_res)]

radial_sweep = cascaded_union(sweep_lines)

# load the input lines and combine them into one geometry
input_lines = fiona.open(""input_lines.shp"")
input_shapes = [shape(f['geometry']) for f in input_lines]
all_input_lines = cascaded_union(input_shapes)

perimeter = []
# traverse each radial sweep line and check for intersection with input lines
for radial_line in radial_sweep:
    inter = radial_line.intersection(all_input_lines)

    if inter.type == ""MultiPoint"":
       # radial line intersects at multiple points
       inter_dict = {}
       for inter_pt in inter:
           inter_dict[focal_pt.distance(inter_pt)] = inter_pt
       # save the nearest intersected point to the sweep centre point
       perimeter.append(inter_dict[min(inter_dict.keys())])

    if inter.type == ""Point"":
       # radial line intersects at one point only
       perimeter.append(inter)

    if inter.type == ""GeometryCollection"":
       # radial line doesn't intersect, so skip
       pass

# combine the nearest perimeter points into one geometry
solution = cascaded_union(perimeter)

# save the perimeter geometry
schema = {'geometry': 'MultiPoint', 'properties': {'test': 'int'}}
with fiona.open('perimeter.shp', 'w', 'ESRI Shapefile', schema) as e:
     e.write({'geometry':mapping(solution), 'properties':{'test':1}})

",Rusty Magoo,https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/20518,"I have reproduced your example with shapefiles. 

You can use Shapely and Fiona to solve your problem.

1) Your problem (with a shapely Point):



2) starting with an arbitrary line (with an adequate length):

from shapely.geometry import Point, LineString
line = LineString([(point.x,point.y),(final_pt.x,final_pt.y)])




3) using shapely.affinity.rotate to create the radii (rotating the line from the point, look also the Mike Toews's answer at Python, shapely library: is it possible to do an affine operation on shape polygon?):

from shapely import affinity
# Rotate i degrees CCW from origin at point (step 10°)
radii= [affinity.rotate(line, i, (point.x,point.y)) for i in range(0,360,10)]




4) now, using shapely:cascaded_union (or shapely:unary_union) to get a MultiLineString:

from shapely.ops import cascaded_union
mergedradii = cascaded_union(radii)
print mergedradii.type
MultiLineString


5) the same with the original lines (shapefile)

import fiona
from shapely.geometry import shape
orlines = fiona.open(""orlines.shp"")
shapes = [shape(f['geometry']) for f in orlines]
mergedlines = cascaded_union(shapes)
print mergedlines.type
MultiLineString


6) the intersection between the two multigeometries is computed and the result is saved to a shapefile:

 points =  mergedlines.intersection(mergedradii)
 print points.type
 MultiPoint
 from shapely.geometry import mapping
 schema = {'geometry': 'MultiPoint','properties': {'test': 'int'}}
 with fiona.open('intersect.shp','w','ESRI Shapefile', schema) as e:
      e.write({'geometry':mapping(points), 'properties':{'test':1}})


Result:



7) but, problem, if you use a a longer radius, the result is different:



8) And if you want to get your result, you need to select only the point with the shortest distance from the original point on a radius:

points_ok = []
for line in mergeradii:
   if line.intersects(mergedlines):
       if line.intersection(mergedlines).type == ""MultiPoint"":
          # multiple points: select the point with the minimum distance
          a = {}
          for pt in line.intersection(merged):
              a[point.distance(pt)] = pt
          points_ok.append(a[min(a.keys())])
       if line.intersection(mergedlines).type == ""Point"":
          # ok, only one intersection
          points_ok.append(line.intersection(mergedlines))
solution = cascaded_union(points_ok)
schema = {'geometry': 'MultiPoint','properties': {'test': 'int'}}
with fiona.open('intersect3.shp','w','ESRI Shapefile', schema) as e:
     e.write({'geometry':mapping(solution), 'properties':{'test':1}})


Final result:



I hope that is what you want.

Is it possible that this is because of the SHA1 implementation being used? In that case, I could try to use another one.

I'm no expert of cryptography, but the OAuth RFC 5849 is saying that RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5-SIGN needs to be used, which seems to be the case for the library.

Thank you very much.
",Simon,https://stackoverflow.com/users/49086,"I tried both the openssl command and the JS library you mentioned above, and the results are consistent. The signatures that I get from both ways are the same.

One thing I noticed from your post is that, the base64 encoded result generated from the library is way too long and looks wrong. Is it possible that you are not base64-encoding the binary signature?

Could you try this code for getting the base64 encoded string of the signature?

function doSign() {
  var rsa = new RSAKey();
  rsa.readPrivateKeyFromPEMString(document.form1.prvkey1.value); //replace with your private key
  var hSig = rsa.signString(""x"", ""sha1"");

If you compare the value of ""base64_encoded_signature"" with what you get from the openssl command, they should be the same.

3041,3813,question and answer 6063,Local user accounts have disappeared after installing Active Directory and running dcpromo,"I'm kinda newbie in this Windows 2008 Server R2 configuration stuff, so I would appreciate any help regards the issue I'm facing.

After a Windows 2008 Server R2 clean install I created a couple of local user accounts and joined them to the administrators group, I tested them and I was able to log on with each one.

Then I installed Active Diectory role (DNS role implied) and runned DCPromo. The domain was created and promoted succesfully and I was able to log on into the domain from a client machine.

The issue began when I realized that I was no longer able to log on locally into the server (meaning LOCALMACHINE\localusername). I looked into domain user accounts and noticed that the local user accounts I created previously were now part of the domain. I consider a bad thing not being able to log on locally anymore, so in a shot to fix it I stopped the Active Directory service... my bad! Now I'm sort of locked up, I can't log either locally or as part of the domain.

Can someone please shed some light in this? What did I miss in the process? I tried googling but could find any straight forward solution or explanation. What concept I'm not catching?How can I promote a server to PDC and still be able to log on locally?

Thanks in advanced.

3050,3822,question and answer 6080,"both ""will"" ""would"" in one sentence","From a BBC article:


  The rise comes as Russia said it would will resume shipments of natural gas to Ukraine after Kiev makes its first payment for previous supplies next week.


Would and will both together? Is this a typo, or some kind of a verb form?
",Oleksiy Markunin,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/96337,"As Jon Hanna points out in a comment, the quoted language clearly includes a mistake of a type that no one at the BBC would make out of ignorance; rather it involves a stray word that the author and/or editor forgot to remove after tinkering with the wording of the sentence. It isn't accurate to call mistakes of this type typos; at the publications where I've worked, we call them brainos.

It's easy to see what triggered the tinkering: The sentence starts in present tense (""The rise comes"") but shifts to past tense in order to handle the paraphrasing of the communique from Russia (""as Russia said"")—leaving the author or editor to fiddle with deciding whether to pick up from the present tense rises or from the past tense said to handle the ""it will resume shipments""/""it would resume shipments"" section of the sentence, bearing in mind that the sentence eventually returns to present tense with ""makes its first payment.""

The odd verb out is evidently said, since it casts Russia's promises of future action as past, even though that action and the conditions precedent to it have not yet occurred. Under the circumstances, the writer/editor would probably have been better off putting the sentence this way:


  The rise coincides with an assurance from Russia that it will resume shipments of natural gas to Ukraine after Kiev makes its first payment next week for supplies previously delivered.

3051,3823,question and answer 6081,Changing PhD topic and effect on career,"I'm a PhD student in my third year (4-6 is common in my country) and seriously consider abandoning my current topic. 
The new topic is in the same general field (CS related), yet in a vastly different domain and would need a quite different methods. My advisor suggested this switch, he could keep me funded in both cases, yet probably better with the new topic.

Arguments for switching are both personal interest in the new topic (it's recently trending, I was interested from the beginning, yet few positions were available) and lack of progress in the current area:


I could produce some publications, yet not up to my advisors expectations (should be easier with the new topic, given the impact factors of the journals my advisor suggested)
For the last 6-8 month I made barely any progress (lots of failed experiments)
I would probably have to abandon my current methods anyway due to 1./2., so half a year or so will be lost learning new methods no matter how I decide


Yet I shy away from switching, mainly due to already being quite old (combination of personal problems and a switch of my major as an undergraduate) and fearing how my C.V. would look if I did take about a year longer and had this second switch...

This sounds like you have not treated your prelims as a contract negotiation. 

The best advice I've received is that when you pitch your thesis topic to the committee, make sure that everyone agrees on the structure and methodologies involved. That way, if your work falters or your experiments fail, but you followed the guidance outlined by your committee, then you have still earned a pass.

Another piece of great advice is this: nobody is going to read your thesis. 

Do not switch your program and do not start over, just complete the tasks you were given and move on. If you decide to switch fields later on, fine... that's normal, reasonable, and expected.

And just because you're studying one thing in school doesn't mean that's what you have to do for the rest of your life. There have been plenty of PhDs that completely jumped fields of study, out of CS and into sociology for example... or vice versa. Besides, the latest rage these days is adding ""multi-disciplinary"" to your grant proposals.

3089,3871,question and answer 6162,"Can the term ""jack/jerk off"" be used for female masturbation?","I apologize for this potentially obscene question.

Can the terms jack off or jerk off be used for female masturbation? If not (which is my intuition), what would be the not too poetic vulgar slang equivalent? By too poetic I refer to expressions such as spank the monkey, choke the chicken, etc.

I checked online dictionaries, and most of them don't expand on the usage, and some of the definitions in the Urban Dictionary imply that jack off primarily refers to male masturbation, but do not provide the female counterpart.

Because .validate() is only the initialization method of the plugin, it is not the testing method.  The .validate() method only gets called once on DOM ready to initialize the plugin with your rules &amp; options.  All subsequent calls are ignored.

You would use the .valid() method to programmatically trigger a validation test on demand.

Your code should look more like this...

$(document).ready(function() {

    $('form#myForm').validate({ // initialize the plugin
        // rules &amp; options
    });

",MOON,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/15207,"There are seven countries which have territorial claims on parts of Antarctica: Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, and Norway, which all recognize each other's claims; and Chile and Argentina, whose claims are disputed.

In practice, however, all claims are suspended under international treaty, and there are no checkpoints or immigration officers. For most people, a visit to Antarctica consists of a flight over it or a ride on a ship through its waters, neither involving disembarkation and thus both avoiding immigration formalities.

Land tourism does exist, and a permit is required. The vast majority of visitors will arrive by commercial ship or helicopter, and the tour operator is responsible for obtaining the necessary permits. You may, of course, need a visa for the country where your tour is departing from.

To land on the continent in a private vessel such as a yacht, you would need to obtain a permit yourself from your own government, if your country is a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty System. For example, Britons would apply to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Polar Regions Department; Americans would file the DS-4131 Advance Notification Form – Tourist and Other Non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area with the Department of State’s Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs

Due to Antartica's extreme physical conditions and remoteness, only a few dozen yachts make the trip each year, and there are special yachting guidelines for Antarctic cruises.

No, you'll have to restore from backup sorry.

That said I did just want to clarify that you meant you have 8 disks, 1 disk group with two spares and two virtual disks using VRAID5 - is that right? I just wanted to get the terminology right as your question wasn't as clear as it could be.

Can I suggest that when you get this back up and running you configure the disk group to only have a single spare, not double - not for such a small array. Then use either VRAID 6 or 10 (0+1 actually), they're much more resilient than VRAID 5.

Oh and on one final note - these aren't the 1TB FATA disks are they? a few years ago we saw a ridiculous number of these fail, many at the same time - due to miscommunicated duty-cycle requirements - we abandoned using those disks. I'm just keen to help you avoid a repeat of this issue.

In other words: Can I edit a symlink? If not, why not?



I do understand that there are various ways of replacing symlinks (two alternatives are currently in the answers section) but it would be interesting to get an explanation on why replacement seems to be the only way to deal with symlinks. Why can't you just change where they point?
",Oli,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/880,"Symbolic links need to be modified atomically. If you're halfway through writing them, they won't work.
The content of a symbolic link is pretty small (at most 4095 characters on Linux: the maximum length of a path to a file), so there would be little point in editing part of a symbolic link at the kernel level. Therefore the kernel does not offer any interface to edit a symbolic link, only an interface to create a new one, the symlink system call (plus the generic interface unlink to remove any file).

The symlink system call only creates a new symbolic link, it does not remove any existing file. This is annoying, but consistent with other system calls to create files such as open (which can create a new file or truncate an existing file, but not replace an existing file by a newly-created file) and mkdir.

In the shell, as you've discovered, while you can't replace a symbolic link atomically with the ln command (ln -sf unlinks the previous file then creates the symbolic link), you can do it by first creating a symbolic link under a temporary name and then moving it into place.

tmp=$(TMPDIR=$(dirname -- ""$link"") mktemp)
ln -sf -- ""$target"" ""$tmp""
mv -f ""$tmp"" ""$link""

As you've noted, it's Brutus from Julius Caesar, by William Shakespeare.

These seem to be options (partially obscured) of the phone.


  ""Let me walk with you when I'm lost in the wild
  I know you always lead me to another Eden
  Let me bless your name, O Lord, O Lord
  Your words will never fade away
  Since we believe you're the light on earth
  Reveals the world"" 


Also from the ""Reveal the world"" song lyrics.

The rest seems to be proper names and instances from the show itself, like ""noblesse oblige"", and ""Juiz"", and ""Selecao system
12 persons selected in Japan"". So the only real quote I guess is from the Julius Caesar play.

",ab.aditya,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/1977,"Each light source has a color cast of some sort, daylight is blue, fire and indecent light are yellow, florescent is often green, our brain knows how to ""filter out"" the color of the light to make it look white.

Auto white balance tries to do the same thing the brain does and automatically filter out the light's color cast, however, the AWB algorithm in the camera is not good enough to compete with the brain (after all, digital photography is fairly new, the brain had million of years of evolution to get things right) - so it often gets thigns wrong.

Manual white balance does not try to guess anything, by looking at a picture of a white (or neutral gray) object the camera can calculate the exact color cast of the light and filter it out perfectly - perfect color every time (if you have the time to set white balance).

(The camera can find the real color based on a wrongly light balanced jpeg because the camera knows what light balance was used for that jpeg)

3158,3956,question and answer 6312,Equitably distributed curve on a sphere,"Let $\gamma=\gamma(L)$ be a
simple (non-self-intersecting) closed curve of length $L$
on the unit-radius sphere $S$.
So if $L=2\pi$, $\gamma$ could be a great circle.

I am seeking the most equitably distributed
$\gamma(L)$, distributed in the sense that
the length of $\gamma$ within any disk is minimized.
This is something like placing repelling electrons on a sphere,
but here the curve self-repels.
So there should be no ""clots"" of $\gamma$ anywhere on $S$.
I am especially interested in large $L$.
A possible $\gamma$ is shown below, surely not optimal for its length:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;




Here is an attempt to capture more formally ""equitably distributed.""
I find this an awkward definition, and perhaps there is a more
natural definition.

Around a point $c \in S$, measure the $r$-density
of $\gamma$ as the total length within an $r$-disk:
$$d_\gamma(c,r) = | \gamma \cap D(c,r)|$$
where $D(c,r)$ is the disk of geodesic radius $r$
centered on $c$.
Then define $d_\gamma(r)$ as the maximum of $d_\gamma(c,r)$ over
all $c \in S$.

Finally, we can say that, for two curves $\gamma_1$ and
$\gamma_2$ of the same length $L$, that
$\gamma_1 \le \gamma_2$
if $d_{\gamma_1}(r) \le d_{\gamma_2}(r)$
for all $r \in (0,\pi)$, i.e.,
$\gamma_1$ is less concentrated than $\gamma_2$ for all $r$
up to a hemisphere.

This definition provides a partial order on curves of a given length $L$.
One version of my question is:


  Q. What do the minimal elements of this poset
  look like, especially as $L$ gets large?


These minimal curves are in some sense nowhere densely clotted.

Update. Acknowledging Gerhard Paseman's remark, I thought I would include
this attractive image of a space-filling curve on a sphere:

&nbsp;


&nbsp;
(Image from this website).

But notice it is certainly not equidistributed in any sense, crowding near the northpole.
",Joseph O'Rourke,https://mathoverflow.net/users/6094,"to me the best possible solution seems to be the sequence of closed Hilbert curves on the Cubed Sphere;
that curve consists of six ordinary Hilbert Curves, one for each face of a cube, which, when appropriately connected, yield a space-filling Jordan Curve for the cube's surface.
Then centrally projecting those curves onto a cocentric sphere yields a solution without crowding, albeit a slightly higher density around the projections of the cube's corners.

A further improvement may result from rounding away the corners in a similar fashion as is used for tennis balls, which is the rounding applied to your example.  

Yet another, maybe even better, bet would be Hamilton Cycles of Hamiltonian Fullerene Graphs (cf e.g. http://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.3854.pdf for a discussion); that bet is based on the honeycomb conjecture (cf e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb_conjecture) and on the fact, that Fullerene graphs are the closest one can get to a hexagonal tiling of the sphere (there are twelve inevitable pentagons).
Examples of Hamiltonian Fullerene graphs are depicted here: http://www.academia.edu/4269519/On_the_Hamiltonicity_of_Fullerenes.

The problem is what the word ""only"" modifies. ""Only"" will modify the next word in the sentence, so if the next word is ""is"" then it means ""is"" is the only thing that the subject does, but if it modifies ""this"" it means the subject is unique.

Normally ""this is true"" is a statement, and ""is this true"" is a question. But when you need to modify ""is"", you run into this problem. English is full of strange exceptions like this one.

3208,4019,question and answer 6416,XOR Gate design problem,"I just recently started trying out on electronics engineering, and have built a OR gate, NOT gate and a AND gate using NPN transistors. When building the XOR gate, this is my design:



However, SW2 will not activate the LED due to the current at the base of Q4 (activated by SW2) activates Q5 to bypass the LED. Thus, the Q3 &amp; Q4's AND gate does not work. Is there any way I can get the between Q4 and Q5 to not flow unless both Q3 and Q4 have been activated?

Thanks in advance! I'm such a newbie.

P.S. The simulation lets the current flow from the positive side to the negative side.
",ihsoy ih,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/27005,"Conceptually, I can see why you implemented the circuit this way:


If either of SW1 or SW2 is closed - either Q1 or Q2 will conduct and the current will flow to the LED
However, if both SW1 and SW2 are closed - both Q3 and Q4 will conduct which will cause Q5 to conduct. When Q5 is conducting, there is not enough voltage on LED to turn it on


Good thinking, really.

However, BJTs have high current gain (\$\beta\approx100\$). It means that even a low current to the base of Q5 will be amplified and the LED won't turn on. But how comes there is a current to the base of Q5 when SW1 is open? Isn't Q3 behaves as an open circuit when SW1 is open? The answer is NO - BJT transistors have very interesting behavior when operated with floating base. They are not, in general, behave like an open circuit.

What can you do? Well, in real applications you wouldn't design and use such a circuit. However, given that you are educating yourself (and me too), I'd suggest you try to apply the following changes:


Why did you choose 9V power supply? Each BJT has a maximum rating for \$V_{CE}\$ - check the model file that you're using and change your power supply accordingly. How this may help? Well, reducing \$V_{CE}\$ of Q3 may cause it to behave more like an open circuit when SW1 is open.
Try to add pull-down resistors between bases of Q3 and Q4 and the ground (these resistors must be pretty large). This approach will prevent the base of Q3 from being floating when SW1 is open (respectively for Q4 and SW2).
If none of the above worked, I suggest you'll try to find a way of ""stealing"" the current from the led which is not that sensitive to small unwanted currents as a single transistor. You may try to replace Q5 with Q3 and Q4 directly (collector of Q3 is connected in place of Q5's collector, emitter of Q4 is connected to ground).


Please let me know about the results.

Unfortunately, instead of the photo album protecting the pictures, the plastic coverings yellowed, and the pictures themselves had to be carefully extracted from the books. There is also quite a bit of powdered paper (the backings on the books pretty much fell apart while we extracted the pictures), and the fronts of the images are still a bit sticky.

These pictures are 30+ years old, are often extremely faded, and were originally taken on (what I think is) ""110 film"" -- they are approximately 2.5"" squares.

Anyway, I need to scan all these images in to preserve them from further decay. Unfortunately, it's taking forever -- going through less than 100 images took an entire day, even if one discounts any time spent in Photoshop trying to remove some of the photo album's artifacts on the images.

What I really need is some method of scanning the images in faster. Most automated solutions aren't going to work because they accept 4x6s as their smallest image size, and even if that was not the case, the adhesives still stuck to the prints would probably ruin any such device in 5 seconds flat.

3236,4053,question and answer 6470,Can symmetry be restored in high energy scattering?,"Suppose you have a field theory with a real scalar field $\phi$ and a potential term of the form $\lambda \phi^4 - \mu \phi^2$ that breaks the symmetry $\phi \to - \phi$ in the ground state. Is this symmetry restored in a scattering with high momentum transfer in any physically meaningful way? My problem is that there is no background field for which I could take a mean field approximation, so the usual argument for phase transitions does not work. 

One thing that came to my mind is that the potential will have higher order corrections, so maybe one could ask which way these corrections work in the limit $\Lambda \to \infty$, where $\Lambda$ is a UV scale? I know the first order correction for small $\phi$ does actually contribute to the breaking rather than to restoration, but then that doesn't seem to be the right limit for the scattering. If you don't know the answer I'd also be grateful for a reference. (Please do not point me to references that are for in-medium effects, nuclear matter etc, as I have plenty of these and it's not addressing my problem.)
",WIMP,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/1458,"First of all, the vev of $\phi$ scales like a positive power of $\mu$ which has the units of mass. So all the effects of the symmetry breaking scale like a positive power of the mass scale $\mu$. At energies $E$ satisfying $E\gg \mu$, i.e. much higher than $\mu$, the value of $\mu$ itself as well as vev and other things may simply be neglected relatively to $E$: all the corrections from the symmetry breaking go to zero, relatively speaking.

In the UV, i.e. at short distances, the dimensionless couplings (and interactions) such as $\lambda$ are much more important than the positive-mass-dimension dimensionful couplings such as $\mu$.

It's still true that the high-energy theory wasn't exactly symmetric in the treatment above; it was just approximately symmetric. However, in fact, sometimes it is exactly symmetric under the sign flip of $\phi$. That's because the value of $\mu$ runs, as in the renormalization group, and in many interesting theories, $\mu$ actually switches the sign at energies exceeding some critical energy scale $E_0$. So the high energy theory may have a single symmetry-preserving minimum of the potential and the symmetry breaking may be a result of the flow to low energies.

It's legitimate you want to know the higher-loop corrections to the Higgs potential but the subtlety you should appreciate is that all these calculations proceed relatively to some renormalization (mass) scale. If the scale is low, the behavior of the theory at much higher energies may only be deduced by the (inverted) RG flows. However, the deduction of the short-distance theory from its long-distance effective field theory approximation is never exact; it's the high-energy theory that is the legitimate starting point and the low-energy physics is its consequence.

What you're looking for is an upgraded sway bar.  This is ""... usually a torsion spring that resists body roll motions.""  This is in contrast to a strut bar ""... designed to reduce ... strut tower flex by tying two parallel strut towers together.""

In general, if your goal is to reduce body roll, one of the cheapest ways to do so is to upgrade the sway bar(s).  Strut tower bars will have a much more limited effect and should usually be considered after upgrading tires, sway bars, struts and springs (i.e., much later).

Caveat: increasing the roll stiffness will change your under/oversteering biases.  Specifically, a stiffer bar in the front generally increases understeer.  Likewise, a stiffer rear will increase oversteer.  That said, I had a 97 Integra some time back and installed an adjustable rear sway bar.

To more generally state that you and your friends go to the cinema (particularly if your going to the cinema is more important than who you go with, or if your going to the cinema and your going there with friends are equally important) then the second form you proposed would be the correct one to use.

Please note I speak British English, and while I am fairly confident that what I've said also applies to other dialects, I am not certain of it.

3319,4158,question and answer 6629,Determining The Parameters Of A Wheatstone Bridge,"Good day, 

I am trying to use a Wheatstone bridge to condition a thermistor. The arrangement i have is shown in below.

I need the following specifications.


10V output max from the bridge at maximum temperature (50 degrees celcius)
0V output max from the bridge at minimum temperature (0 degrees celcius)


I have determined the resistance of the thermistor at the minimum and maximum temperature to be as follows


At max temperature R = 174
At min temperature R = 1.1K


I know that for the wheatstone bridge to be balanced i need the following for my arrangement

R1/R3 = R2/Rt

So i have set R3 = 1.1K and Chose R1=R2=1500k (arbitrary value)

With this i do get 0V output at 0 degrees.

My problem is now, how do i ensure that the output voltage i get is 10V at 50 degree celcius, as i currently get 8.7V output with the source voltage set to 24V.

Any help would be appreciated, Thanks.
",Ozwurld,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/69443,"With a 24 volt supply, the current thru the limb of the bridge containing the thermistor is: -


Nearly 11mA at 0C
Nearly 19mA at 50C


At 0C this produces a power in the thermistor of 132mW and 63mW at 50C. To me this is a problem. The self-heating of the thermistor will create a significant measurment error at 0C compared to 50C. I'd use an instrumentation amplifier and keep the excitation levels much lower to prevent significant self-heating errors: -



The picture above shows the AD620 powered from +5V and 0V but a better power regime (for the OP) is +/- 15V with 0V connected to pin 5 (the reference input). The excitation voltage can be much lower (say 2.5 volts) and this means the self-heating effects are 1.5mW at 0C and 0.7mW at 50C i.e. trivial.

However, there is another potential problem of a single thermistor in a wheatstone bridge and that is linearity. You may design a circuit that produces the correct voltages at the extremes of temperature you require but, between these two points, there is a non-linear mapping between voltage and temperature over and above the basic non-linearity of the thermistor's resistance change with temperature.

It might seem intuitive to place 2 thermistors at opposite sides of the bridge but, with voltage excitation, this won't improve linearity (but does double sensitivity). Here is a good document by ADI explaining all of this: -



However, if you adopted a current driven bridge configuration then you could use two thermistors and get perfect linearity: -



So, rounding up, try to avoid self-heating effects and, for greater linearity, use two elements in opposing faces of the bridge with the bridge excitation being a constant current like the one below: -



The important voltage to keep constant in the above diagram is that across R1 and, for high accuracy a precision shunt voltage reference would be used in place of R1.

First, my impression from skimming some geometric group theory is that a finitely presented group cannot be an infinite free product.  Moreover, that it if it is a finite free product, the factors have unique isomorphism types.  If this impression is correct, then you can identify the knot group $\pi_1(S^n \setminus K)$ from the embedded fundamental group $\pi_1(M \setminus K)$.  In order to be trivial in $M$, the knot group of $K$ would have to be $\mathbb{Z}$.

Then, Aspherical manifolds and higher-dimensional knots, by Bruno Eckmann, begins:


  E. Dyer and R. Vasquez proved that the complement of a higher-dimensional
  knot $S^{n-2} \subset S^n$, $n \ge 4$, is never aspherical unless the knot group is infinite cyclic (and hence, for $n \ge 5$, the imbedding is unknotted). [Footnote referring to papers of Levine, Stallings, Wall, Shaneson.] In the present note we give a simple proof of this fact based on some remarks concerning compact $\partial$-manifolds.


My impression is that the surgery methods in dimension $n \ge 5$ used to prove the unknottedness assertion are valid in the smooth, PL, and continuous categories.  Dimension $n=3$ is of course a special case where you do not need to consider algebraic topology, but instead prove things with direct cut-and-paste arguments as Ryan describes.  In dimension $n=4$, the surgery theory is (a) much more difficult in the continuous category, and (b) non-existent in the smooth/PL category.

The paper The algebraic characterization of the exteriors of certain 2-knots, by Jonathan Hillman, credits Freedman with the result that a 2-knot with knot group $\mathbb{Z}$ is unknotted.  If this requires Freedman's work, then I would think that it is open in the smooth/PL case.  What would be open is whether the 4-manifold with boundary $B^3 \times S^1$ has more than one smooth structure.  If it does, I have seen a principle that smooth structures on a 4-manifold can merge together when you take a connected sum with manifolds such as $\pm \mathbb{C}P^2$ an $S^2 \times S^2$.  I do not know if this principle is established for manifolds with a fundamental group.  But at the very least, I have heard that the semigroup of smooth structures on $S^4$ is completely unknown, and its action on the smooth structures on another 4-manifold is completely unknown.  So if the smooth Poincare conjecture is sufficiently false, presumably you could have a non-trivial 2-knot in $B$ that becomes trivial in $M$.

I've recently noticed that when this ""running water"" sound occurs that it is more prominent when the engine is running faster (e.g. during acceleration).  This leads me to believe maybe this has something to do with the water pump, or some other liquid pump, that is run by the engine and not moving enough liquid to fill the pipe, hence a sloshing / running water sound.

  \Tri{a}{1}{(-1,0)}
  \Tri{b}{1}{(1,0)}
  \Tri{c}{1}{(0,1.41)}

The \Tri command accepts three arguments; the first and the second ones are enclosed in braces, while the third is between parentheses, so

\Tri{a}{3}(0,0)


In the body of the definition you'll use (#3) instead of #3, because the parentheses are stripped off.

In the case of \TriTri we have to split off the two coordinates, so we define four arguments; the first and the second ones are enclosed in braces; the third is what goes from ( to a comma, the final one is everything up to ).

Nevermind, for the first time I accept I was wrong. BUT using lightyears to measure time is possible. My example didn't make sense bacause I was wrong when I meantioned that I'm still measuring dist. If you have a signal in time domain and ...take the FT, I get a signal which DOES NOT HAVE to be in frequency domain. Clarify this to the guy who posted last. Now the new signal is in a domain defined by me and so is its units. This signal although not equal to the original signal, still represents that if ya take an inverse FT. So, the idea of time will still be there. Now coming back to our case: lightyears here is not the lightyears you are used to read when dealing with distance. It represents time.

I know a man walks 5 km/h, hence
space is a unit of time because I can say 10 km is equivalent to two hours, hence
I can measure time by specifying a distance. Let's meet in 5 kilometers at the pub 200 meters from here.


But that's not a unit definition. it's just a deep misrepresentation of concepts: using this approach, you can define everything in terms of anything else, assuming there's a relationship among them. you could define time in terms of weight of apples a man can move from the tree to a box.

Also, the whole setup is pretty circular in definition. You define time as space traveled by something at a constant speed for a defined time, so in the end your pulled you own bootstraps.


  My example didn't make sense
  bacause I was wrong when I meantioned
  that I'm still measuring dist. If you
  have a signal in time domain and
  ...take the FT, I get a signal which
  DOES NOT HAVE to be in frequency
  domain.


A Fourier transform is nothing but finding the coefficients of a linear combination of plane waves. When you find these coefficients, you can express the original function as the linear combination of these coefficients and a plane wave. If you note, there's a unit relationship between the domain before the FT and after. seconds -> seconds^(-1) = Hz. So even if you want to do fourier decomposition of a space-based periodic or aperiodic system, the resulting domain will be in meters^(-1), which is eventually a wave number. 


  Clarify this to the guy who
  posted last. Now the new signal is in
  a domain defined by me and so is its
  units.


Nope, it just turns out from the dimensional analysis that this is not the case. Clearly, you can always transform your frobbles units into Hertz through an ad-hoc transformation you invent (see the man-apples above) but that would still not change the final dimensional analysis of your FT, and you would, in any case, introduce an arbitrary constant (in our case above, the walking speed) which, in the end, likely produces a circular definition.


  This signal although not equal
  to the original signal, still
  represents that if ya take an inverse
  FT. So, the idea of time will still be
  there. Now coming back to our case:
  lightyears here is not the lightyears
  you are used to read when dealing with
  distance. It represents time.


Lightyears is a measure of distance. It is a product of two well defined constants: the speed of light and a well defined amount of time. Simple dimensional analysis tells you it's a distance.

Edit: non-tech note. there's nothing wrong not to know things. Tell your friend it's not my intention to mock him. There's, however, something wrong to pretend to be right through misunderstood justification. It looks like he is mature enough to understand he is wrong, which is the spirit we should all live with. I hope my answers clarifies his doubts. Note that I could be wrong myself. I don't know the technicalities of standard unit definitions, and my exposition could be patched by someone who knows more than me on this field. The approximation I present here is good enough for the purpose of explanation, but it is wrong nevertheless when we go down to the gritty details, and I am ready to accept criticism on this regard. This is how we progress.

Please have a look at the manual: http://www.fondriest.com/pdf/rm_young_05103_manual.pdf
And here is the figures about my questions:


In Figure A, the potentiometer is used to output voltage proportional to the wind vane rotation angle.

In Figure B, the potentiometer comes to an end at point 1 and causes a short between the lines WHT(wind excitation voltage) and GRN(wind direction signal). But in theory current flows from + to ground. Do you think there is a path for current to flow in Figure B?

In Figure C, it seems like the situation is safe. Although the lines GRN and BLK are shorted at point 2, there is no potential difference and no current flows. Is that right?

My real confusion is about D6 and D7 the transzorb diodes(zener clampers?). I couldn’t really figure out in which circumstances they function and what happens in the absence of them. Why do we really need them?

3390,4256,question and answer 6784,Isn’t the FAQ label obsolete by now?,"Don’t get me wrong in the beginning of reading this. I really mean the label and not the content of FAQ. The content is very useful if its’ made the right way (as here on ux.se), but there are plenty of examples where it isn’t. The real question concerns the label which is a convention I’d like to challenge.

History

In 1647 Matthew Hopkins wrote The Discovery of Witches which were introduced as ""Certain Queries answered"" and had the form of a list of Question and Answer, even if the topic is inappropriate by today’s standards. The label FAQ origins from the early 1980s mailing lists where NASA hoped to get new users read the old mail conversations, which were not the case. Instead the same questions were answered again and again and the need for FAQ was born. The acronym FAQ was invented by Eugene Miya and FAQ were later used in mail on a weekly basis at first and later on as a daily mail.


  Today FAQ is more frequently used to refer to the list, and a text consisting of questions and their answers is often called an FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually frequently asked, if they are asked at all.[1]


Problem

Acronyms are generally bad, since it excludes those who do not know the meaning. They either have to search for the acronym, if they are interested, or just ignore it. If a label is ignored, there is not much use of it and an entire section of valid content is lost by bad labeling. However, it is a very strong web convention which might lead to confusion over time for experienced users.
Also the original meaning have changed (see quote), which also implies that the label would be wrong.

Question

Isn’t the FAQ label obsolete by now? and if so How do we relabel it to suit both experienced and new users?



Edit: I’d really like to know why we can or cannot change the label FAQ. Current answer does not meet that criterion.

By and large, when you find that an ordinary suffix has been attached to a word of the sort it is ordinarily attached to, and that the resulting sense is exactly that which such compounds ordinarily bear, it’s a legitimate word regardless of whether it appears in a dictionary. That’s what linguists mean when they say that a suffix or idiomatic pattern is ‘productive’: that it is regularly used to create valid new words or phrases. 

(And observe, please, that calling a term a neologism does not ‘invalidate’ it, whatever that might mean. To say a word is ‘valid’ can only mean that it is used and understood within its particular context or register, regardless of its age.)

In this case, -able is regularly attachable to any transitive VERB to express the meaning capable of being VERBed. Learn is a transitive verb, and learnable means capable of being learned. That’s all it takes.

Above 2 functions inside the $(""#list"").click() block are being skipped for some reason in IE, not FF, Chrome

What's going on:

There is a button #list and a container #multiselect_container which holds #multiselect which is a select box of it's container's size.

When #list is clicked, the select box is hidden and the container beneath it is shown, with a loading bar.

When the ajax call is finished the loading bar is removed and the select box is shown again.

In Firefox this works perfectly fine. In IE it does not.

Things that I have tried:


$('#list').ajaxComplete(function() {}); in the success section

Removing the ajax block, those 2 calls are made properly.

I've had a similar problem with IE before, where it just didn't want to update the display to show a ""loading"" type message while doing Ajax - even though the Ajax is asynchronous. It's not that the functions themselves are skipped, just that the display doesn't get updated until after the Ajax complete callback had executed too - and since the complete processing removes the ""loading"" message it's as if it never existed from the user's point of view. As with your code, my project worked fine in Firefox. It was a while ago, but if I remember rightly I got it to work in IE by introducing a short timeout on the Ajax call, something like this:

$(""#list"").click(function()

",Blight,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/67103,"Just to add to what @Barmaley.exe said (+1), if you want probabilities, then use an algorithm that was designed for that purpose, such as the Relevance Vector Machine, Gaussian Process classifier or Kernel Logistic Regression (I like KLR and use it a lot, e.g. here which gives some benchmark results compared to SVM and Gaussian process classification etc.).  Platt scaling will give probability estimates, but they are not likely to be as good as those from a model designed to give a probabilistic output.

One of the ideas behind the SVM is that it is better to solve the problem directly, rather than solving a more general problem and simplifying the answer.  For instance if you are only interested in discrete yes/no classification, then it is better to try and infer the decision boundary directly, rather than estimate the posterior probability of class membership (a more general problem) and then threshold at 0.5 (the simplification step).  The reason for this is that model resources are not allocated to improve the performance of the model away from the decision boundary and the problem of estimating the parameters is simplified, and less data are likely to be required.  The SVM then is likely to do a good job of estimating the decision boundary (or p = 0.5 contour of the probability), but the raw output of the SVM will not necessarily be a good basis for estimating the probability away from the decision boundary.

3458,4347,question and answer 6922,Wireless link frequency choice (900Mhz vs 5.8Ghz) for 2-3km distance,"I have recently been contracted by a client of mine to facilitate the wireless communication of his ""home"" offices and a secondary site. 

The primary site is the top two floors of a 5-story office building (15m height more or less) an the secondary is one of two open ""lots"" (which one is TBD by management). The ground distance from the secondary sites is a little more than 2km for the one closer and around 2.9km for the one furthest. 

The link will be used to transmit the video feed of 1 (or even possibly two) IP cameras and some kind of Ethernet-enabled environmental or weather sensor. I have checked the necessary b/w for the cameras and both 900Mhz and 5.8Ghz are more than adequate for even 4 of them, much more for 2. I have also verified that there is clear line-of-sight to both possible installation points and that the 60% Fresnel Zone clearance is more than covered. Bear in mind that this is my first long distance link (long with or without quotes) and I hate to admit that wireless physics is far from my strong suit.

The ultimate point of my question is that although I have read a lot about frequency choice the last few days, I continue to find some ambiguity (I know it is just me that finds it ambiguous). Most sources, like this one, agree that although the lower frequencies have less losses over a given distance (free-space-loss I learned it is called) they need larger antennae for the same ""strength"" of trasmission (is ""gain"" really the same as ""strength""?). 

So, for the given distance of 2-3km and given also that all typical requirements are met, which is preferable (or do I dare say ""better"") frequency? Should I choose 900Mhz with a relatively ""small"" antenna on the basis that 3km is not really ""long distance"" and that it will provide a link with less attenuation ergo less retransmits ergo higher overall speed? Or should I choose the 5.8Ghz option for the superior b/w (I am still not very sure about this, please correct me if wrong) on the basis that at this distance there is no real difference so why not take the ""better"" one?

On a side note, should I stay to the beaten path of true WiFi or should I consider proprietary bridging solutions like the ones from Ubiquiti? I have a lot of experience with their Access Points and am really satisfied, so I would not mind integrating one more of their products in my client. In any case, I am looking for an optimal solution, choice of vendor is of very little concern at this point.

Forgive my ignorance and the possible mistaken use of language. 

UPDATE:
I arranged to have a spectrum analyzer on loan for a couple of days. I will make sure that the 900Mhz band is reasonably clear and proceed down that way.

UPDATE 2:
I had the aforementioned equipment available to play with for a day and a half. The conclusive finding is that the 9Mhz band is almost ""empty"" in the area, as one suggested here, so that takes care for the frequency choice issue. 

Concerning the equipment now, I am going with Ubiquiti AirMax Yagi antennae and matching RM900 2x2 radios. Preliminary testing on my part and from the client's employees shows that performance exceeds expectations. 

On a side note, the chosen ""lot"" is the one that is 3km away. 
",dsljanus,https://serverfault.com/users/181235,"Chris S's answer is incorrect in several areas.

3km is not approaching the limit of 5.8GHz.  Similarly, that's not as big of a distance as for 2.4GHz wifi either.  Chris says 10X, I say 100X the distance is possible.  The longest range 5.8GHz wifi that I've heard of is 304KM with a 1.2M hand made antenna (See: Long Range Wifi).  I believe it went over water so there were not any thing in the way of the signal.  It used Ubiquity radios.  I don't know if it was reliable, but to get a connection and send data over that distance is nothing short of amazing.  

I used to work for a wisp carrier and had wifi radios about twice the size of your hand easily going 10KM with good line of site.  I personally had wifi on my house going 8KM without any issues.  Amazingly, they were only 500mW.  

We were using 5GHz radios and a mixture of Ubiquity and Microtik hardware.  They work almost flawlessly.

While it is true that with lower frequencies you need bigger antennas.  You'll notice that your home wifi doesn't have large antennas.  Neither do 5GHz ones.

In reality, 2.4GHz should perform better, but 5GHz in my experience works just as well.
In theory, 5GHz could be affected by rain fade, but I didn't find that even over the 8KM link.

As for 2.4GHz and other devices like microwaves and cordless phones inside the office, it doesn't even factor in.  The reason it doesn't factor in is that you'll be using directional antennas.  Better still, if the antenna is on an iron roof you will be shielded from all that noise coming from inside the office/house. 

Having said all of that, I will say that it's not perfect for every situation.
You need:


Line of site between the two buildings. Factoring in the freznel zone (good open clearance)  
A suitable place to mount the antenna to achieve point 1.
Hopefully not much wifi traffic facing your directional antennas (no gaurantees there, but it should be workable) even in a reasonably crowded wifi space.


Freznel zone looks like this:

By the way, I've had trees in the way of the freznel zone and in some cases right in the middle and it still worked, although it does affect the performance a lot.  Install your antennas as high as practical/possible.

You can still get interference issues.  Usually because of other devices transmitting in your direction at the same frequency.  So it's not perfect.  Directional antennas help a lot with that.

I can recommend the 5.8GHz radios simply because I know they work well. And yes, provide good bandwidth! From memory I used a Ubiquity Bullet M5 with a patch antenna (another brand).  The other end was a less directional antenna feeding multiple clients but used a similar Microtik radio.

I don't know of anyone who uses 900MHz.  But I do see you can buy them at around 3X the cost than 2.4 or 5.8.  Stick away from it, it seems uncommon.  In several countries the 900MHz spectrum is quite crowded anyway.



Update: You've been looking at the airmax antennas and the 900MHz radios.  While I think performance should be great.  I think you may be spending much more than you need to... perhaps a little overkill!?  3KM is not a long distance.  I'd try some of these if you can.

http://www.gowifi.co.nz/antennas/5-ghz/directional/5.8-ghz-27-dbi-cast-reflector-grid-antenna.html combined with a Bullet M5.



Update2: You can also mitigate interference issues using polarized antennas.  Here's a good write up that explains the concept.  From memory, we used horizontal polarization.  As I recall sometimes if I set the client radio to vertical polarization I could see maybe 12 AP's.  But when setting it to horizontal I only saw 3 or 4 and half of them were ours.

My work: 
I know a set with $n$ elements has $2^n$ subsets. The way I tackled this problem was to make a finite set like {1,2,3} and tried to make some generalization from it. I made a decision tree diagram to figure out the different subsets. 

If $1$ was contained in the subset, then the different subsets with $1$ would be:
$$\{1,2,3\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1\} $$ 
which made me think there are four subsets. $2^n = 4$ which means $n=2$ but there are 3 elements in here so I generalized it as:
$$2^{n-1}$$
where $n \ge 1$ such that $n \in N $ is how many subsets of X that contain $1$.

And for the subsets of $X$ that don't contain $1$, the answer should come out the same as the previous question because, again, if I were to make a finite set like $\{1,2,3\}$, then the subsets without $1$ would be:
$$\{2,3\}, \{2\}, \{3\},  \{\emptyset\}  $$

which is also, $$2^{n-1}$$
where $n \ge 1$ such that $n \in N $ is how many subsets of X that don't contain $1$.

Let us see the example:

There is a question:
Where is @Html.MailTo in MVC 4?

And the most usefull part of the answer for me is the comment: ""marked up with a helper attribute e.g. [DataType(DataTypes.EmailAddress)]""

But it should be DataType.EmailAddress instead of DataTypes.EmailAddress.

I would like to delete the mistyped s, but I cannot. What should I do?
",qub1n,https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/244159,"Usually you do absolutely nothing. Since the ability to comment was introduced, comments have been considered 2nd class citizens, and have no edit history at all (so you can't see what was changed and when and by whom).  

There is virtually no capability to edit comments for regular users, the only exception being the original author of the comment can edit it at will for 5 minutes after it was posted.  You cannot edit anyone else's comment ever, regardless of reputation.

Moderators can edit comments, but this not a common practice and usually only done for serious issues (such as a useful comment that is very rude or offensive).  Small typos or grammar mistakes are often not changed, simply because it would be a full time job for a moderator to worry about cleaning things up.

The best thing to do if you encounter a typo in a comment that potentially can cause confusion is to leave your own comment and ask ""@bobLoblaw do you mean .....?"".

For the kinds of typos, I'm thinking of things such as:


Forgetting a ""not"" or other typo/omission that causes the comment to say something other than what you think it was intended to mean
A serious spelling mistake that changes the meaning of a post 
A significant typo in a code snippet that would have a different result than what is being intended.


Minor stuff like a missing ""s"" or a using its instead of it's should just be left alone.

Don't flag a comment for moderator attention to correct a typo unless the issue is so serious that it needs to be fixed.  Moderators have enough flags to handle, so they don't need a whole host of new ones asking them to capitalize ""i"" in thousands of comments.

3498,4401,question and answer 6993,Resistance of superconducting wire in parrallel with standard wire,"The formula for parrallel resistors is $\frac{1}{R_T} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$

But how can you use this formula when one of the branches is a superconductor, eg:


Where the red resistor represents a wire with some resistance and the blue line represents a superconducting wire, how can the above equation be used to find the resistance between A and B, as it would mean dividing by zero?
",Jonathan.,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/4,"That formula is not in any way fundamental, the singularity at $R_i\to 0$ doesn't have much of a physical meaning, rather it means that the assumptions with which this formula was derived are violated. Namely that the voltage is nonzero.

The total resistance must be such that
$$
  U = R_{\mathrm{tot}}\cdot I_{\mathrm{tot}}.
$$
Since it's a parallel circuit, this is also
$$
  U = R_1\cdot I_1 = R_2\cdot I_2.
$$
But if one of the resistances is zero, this expression must be zero, and therefore (the total current being nonzero) we have $R_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$. Which is quite intuitive as said in Chris Gerig's comment: if there's a perfect shortcut, why would any electrons bother to take the path with nonzero resistance? They don't, so it wouldn't change anything to simply take the resistor away, in which case only the superconductor would be left, still with a resistance $0$.

Also note that a superconductor doesn't actually have zero resistance, just very much less than ordinary conductors. So you could still use the formula
$$
  \frac1{\tfrac1{R_1}+\tfrac1{R_2}}
$$
where, since $R_1\gg R_2$,
$$
  \tfrac1{R_1}+\tfrac1{R_2}\approx \tfrac1{R_2}
$$
and therefore
$$
  \frac1{\tfrac1{R_1}+\tfrac1{R_2}} \approx \frac1{\frac1{R_2}} = R_2 \approx 0.

Don't use uppercase initials for your symbols - you might clash with built-ins.

Don't use some external user-defined global symbol inside a definition in the manner you have unless there's a good reason to do so (I left that as is, but it's bad practice).

",Yossi Gil,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/3391,"The MWE example presented contains some conceptual errors.

The most relevant one, I think, is that you wish to reference nodes through their text and not through their name. That's what I read in:

\node(b)  [draw,rectangle,text=olive] at (3,0) {there};

The \path syntax should contain a and b, not here and there.

Second, here the late options are used in the wrong manner: once the path is ended, that's it, you can't append stuff anymore. So, in measuring south you are willing to insert path rather than append after command. Moreover, since you are changing path options from the main path to the inserted ones, you may want to use \pgfextra.

You could do this with table of contents.

You can make table contents by using paragraph styles as the ""hook"".

Layout > Table of contents...

Here I pretty much touched only those options that I've explained in the image.

and each of those terms will have child terms. I want to be able to lock down the top level terms but not the child term. 

Basically editors should be able to create as many terms as they want for each of those top level terms.. But those top level terms cant be deleted or modified.

Is that possible?
",rugbert,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/19536,"This not a complete and ready-made answer, but the below should get you started.

First thing to note is, deleting and modifying are different functionalities, so different functions and hooks are relevant to it. Namely we are talking about wp_delete_term() - source and wp_update_term() - source - regarding the functions.

So lets take a look at wp_delete_term(), you have to at least consider two hooks: edit_term_taxonomies and delete_term_taxonomy. They are both relevant because of the bulk action and because of the handling of hierarchical taxonomies.

Below some exemplary code how to approach this. I've tried to explain the most important things inside the code. The rest you have to read up on yourself.

First the edit_term_taxonomies hook:

add_action(
    'edit_term_taxonomies',
    'wpse160191_top_level_lock_down_edit_term_taxonomies',
    10,
    1
);
function wpse160191_top_level_lock_down_edit_term_taxonomies(
    $edit_tt_ids
) {
    $screen_obj = get_current_screen();
    $base = $screen_obj-&gt;base;
    $taxonomy = $screen_obj-&gt;taxonomy;

    if(
        // these are the conditions we are checking against
        // is this a tag edit page
        $base == 'edit-tags'
        // we want this only for a specific taxonomy
        &amp;&amp; $taxonomy == 'category'
        // not super and/or admin
        &amp;&amp; ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' )
        // a least an editor
        &amp;&amp; current_user_can( 'manage_categories' )
    ) {

        // these are the terms up for deletion
        $terms_queue_for_deletion = $_POST['delete_tags'];
        $term_parents_ids = array();
        // we need information if or not one of the terms is a top level one
        foreach ( $terms_queue_for_deletion as $term_id ) {
            $term_obj = get_term_by( 'id', $term_id, 'category' );
            $term_parent = $term_obj-&gt;parent;
            $term_parents_ids[] = $term_parent;
        }

        if( empty( $edit_tt_ids ) ) {
            return;
        }

        if( ! empty( $edit_tt_ids ) ) {
            if ( in_array( 0, $term_parents_ids ) ) {
                $msg = new WP_Error(
                'parent_terms_are_forever',
                __('Sorry, you are not allowed to delete top level terms.')
                );
                wp_die( $msg );
            } else {
                return;
            }
        }
    }
}


Second the delete_term_taxonomy hook:

add_action(
    'delete_term_taxonomy',
    'wpse160191_top_level_lock_down_delete_term_taxonomy',
    10,
    1
);
function wpse160191_top_level_lock_down_delete_term_taxonomy(
    $tt_id
) {

    $screen_obj = get_current_screen();
    $base = $screen_obj-&gt;base;
    $taxonomy = $screen_obj-&gt;taxonomy;

    if (
        // these are the conditions we are checking against
        // is this a tag edit page
        $base == 'edit-tags'
        // we want this only for a specific taxonomy
        &amp;&amp; $taxonomy == 'category'
        // not super and/or admin
        &amp;&amp; ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' )
        // a least an editor
        &amp;&amp; current_user_can( 'manage_categories' )
    ) {
        $term_obj = get_term_by( 'term_taxonomy_id', $tt_id, 'category' );
        $parent_id = $term_obj-&gt;parent;
        if (
            // this applies only to top level terms
            $parent_id == 0
        ) {
            $msg = new WP_Error(
                'parent_terms_are_forever',
                __('s:Sorry, you are not allowed to delete top level terms.')
            );
            wp_die( $msg );
        }
    }
}


As mentioned above, it gets a bit more complicated, mainly because of the AJAX actions. If you are thinking about doing this with the well known and simple check:

if ( defined('DOING_AJAX') &amp;&amp; DOING_AJAX ) {
    // code
}


I can tell you right now, that I'm pretty certain it won't be sufficient enough. Mostly because you won't be able to do all the checks you need. If you are fine with just disabling or, to be exact, removing the link to the AJAX action, you can do it somewhat like this:

add_action(
    'admin_head' ,
    'wpse160191_remove_ajax_delete_link'
);
function wpse160191_remove_ajax_delete_link() {
    $screen_obj = get_current_screen();
    $base = $screen_obj-&gt;base;
    $taxonomy = $screen_obj-&gt;taxonomy;

    if(
        // lets just remove the link on that one page and not everywhere
        $base == 'edit-tags'
        &amp;&amp; $taxonomy == 'category'
    ) {
    ?&gt;
        &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
            jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
                var element = 'span.delete';
                $(element).each(function(){
                    $(element).css('opacity', '0');
                    $(element).css('pointer-events', 'none');
                    $(element).remove();
                });
            });
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;?php
    }
}


Of course you shouldn't do it inline and so on, but you can optimize yourself. This of course is not very satisfying, because we just removed the functionality.

One way I imagine to deal with the AJAX action would be to make use of debug_backtrace(). This would offer a way to determine and handle the AJAX action correctly. It could be implemented into the above shown code. A caveat of course is that debug_backtrace() is performance-wise expensive and in a larger scale surely not recommendable.
Another way would be to implement your own AJAX action as replacement for wp_ajax_delete_tag(), but to do so you have to additionally either have to extend the WP_Terms_List_Table or use some hooks in there to achieve this. Not exactly sure at the moment, so you have to inspect that further yourself.

The procedure for wp_update_term() and disallowing updating/modifying is analogous to the above shown. With the same considerations concerning the AJAX part, especially because of the inline quick edit possibility. 



At first I totally misread the question and gave this as an answer.
Keeping it because it might be useful to others.

What you can do is hooking into the pre_insert_term to do the checks needed.

Code:

add_action( 'pre_insert_term', 'wpse160191_restrict_top_level_term_creation', 10, 2 );
function wpse160191_restrict_top_level_term_creation( $term, $taxonomy ) {
    if( 
        // these are the conditions we are checking against
        // we want this only for a specific taxonomy
        $taxonomy == 'topics'
        // a value of 0 or -1 does indicate the top level
        &amp;&amp; $_POST[ 'parent' ] &lt;= '0'
        // not super and/or admin
        &amp;&amp; ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' )
        // a least an editor
        &amp;&amp; current_user_can( 'manage_categories' )
    ) {
        // the user is an editor and not allowed to add parent terms
        // so return a friendly message so the user at least knows 
        return new WP_Error(
            'parent_terms_not_allowed_for_editors',
            __('Sorry, you are not allowed to add parent terms.')
        );
    } else {
        // a super and/or admin, s|he is allowed to do what s|he wants
        return $term;
    }
}


The pre_insert_term hook is part of the wp_insert_term() function.


Some Notes:


The parent value of the $args is 0, when no parent is selected. But we have no access to those inside the action, the form does return the value of -1 for $_POST[ 'parent' ] if »None« is selected. So &lt;= '0' should work in any case.  
We are not passing the user role to the current_user_can() function, because that is just wrong - although you see it a lot, it still is bad. Instead capabilities are used to determine, which kind of user we are dealing with.

  Apply silicone sealing compound, as shown, to clean oil pan sealing surface. Sealant bead must be 2 to 3 mm thick 
  
  Run along inner side of bolt holes 
  
  The sealing compound bead must not be thicker, otherwise excess sealing compound will enter the oil pan and may block the oil suction pipe strainer. 
  
  Apply silicone sealant bead carefully as shown to areas marked by arrows. (Illustration shows position of sealant bead on cylinder block). 
  
  Install oil pan immediately and tighten all oil pan bolts lightly. 
  
  The oil pan must be flush with the cylinder block. 
  
  Tighten oil pan bolts to 15 Nm. 
  
  Tighten oil pan/transmission bolts to 45 Nm.

3594,4521,question and answer 7166,Differences in student load at liberal arts colleges vs. research universities,"Do students at liberal arts universities have 'harder' courses than students at research universities? 

Computer Science curricula at large research universities have 5 to 6 courses per semester. The Liberal Arts model dictates roughly 4 courses per semester. If the load on the student is considered to be equivalent, there must be something special to the teaching in the Liberal Arts model.

How is it that a 4 course Liberal Arts semester is as intensive as a 6 course research university semester?

UPDATE: Many of the comments below say the course load I mention above is inaccurate. I have obtained the figures as follows.


The Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium (LACS) has released 3 LACS curricula in response to ACM/IEEE CS curriculum recommendations. The first in 1986 in response to the 1978 recommendation, next in 1996 in response to the 1991 recommendation and the most recent in 2007 in response to the 2001 recommendation. The 4 year course breakdown in all the LACS recommendations is roughly the same:

4 courses per semester
30-35% CS courses, 10% math, 5% science, and the rest, i.e. 50% or more courses on arts, humanities and social sciences.

A typical graduation requirement at a research university is at least 120 credits, which comes to 5 3-credit courses per semester. Many require more than 120 so 6 course semesters are not uncommon.

",wsaleem,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/14572,"You are making several unfounded assumptions:


That courses are always 3 credits, so that ""4 courses per semester"" means 12 credits. I have taken courses that were worth 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 credits. Many of the science courses I've taken, including math and computer science courses, have been worth 4 credits. Basic sciences that involve a lecture, lab, and recitation have sometimes been 5 credits.
That most liberal arts colleges follow the LACS recommendations to the letter. 
That the LACS recommendations somehow suggest that less than 120 credits are required for graduation. Here is an example of a liberal arts college following the LACS recommendations for CS and requiring 120 credits. 


I did half of my undergraduate degree at a liberal arts college and then transferred to a large research university for the other half. There was virtually no difference in my courseload between the two - I took exactly one credit more in my two years in the research university. I just pulled up my transcripts, and this is what I took each semester:

The typical suggestion is to never use ECB, but if there is just a single block being encrypted, is it a concern?

The reason I want to use ECB is because I want the encrypted value of the block to be consistent between encryptions for other reasons (so I can check if a value already exists by just comparing the uniqueness of the cipherText).

Updated: Also note that these encrypted values will be stored in a set, so there will not be data leakage by having multiple encrypted values of the same plainText available.
",edhill,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/6569,"Thomas' comment is correct.  While, theoretically, ECB is perfectly acceptable for use in a single block, the lack of any IV means your crypto system will leak information if you ever encrypt the same plaintext with the same key.  Even if you are encrypting discrete messages, I highly recommend using something that has an IV to prevent this kind of attack.

Though I don't know what application you are thinking of, in many cases when you are encrypting SSNs or similar, it may be worth using public/private key cryptography so as not to require having the private key anywhere on the machines that are accepting the input.

3621,4561,question and answer 7229,Why does my switch need to be wired in this fashion?,"Today was my first foray into electronics since high school, in the form of some simple Raspberry Pi experiments. I managed to get a circuit working where a switch controlled an LED with a potentiometer to control the brightness of the LED.

However, I am confused by the wiring of the switch. Firstly, here's a photo of my amazing work:



NOTE: the black lead on the potentiometer is not connected to anything (hard to tell in the photo). Also, I realised afterwards that I could have just inserted the potentiometer into the breadboard rather than soldering wires to it. Noob mistake (one of many).

Here's an attempt at a schematic (also probably wrong because I don't know what I'm doing):







simulate this circuit &ndash; Schematic created using CircuitLab

As you can see, I used a PiFace, which comes with the four switches located at the left and towards the bottom of the photo. It is the wiring of this switch that befuddles me. Since each switch has two terminals, I was expecting one terminal to act as an input and the other as an output. That is, I just feed my circuit through those two terminals and job done. But that didn't work.

I managed to find this image online:



This is what prompted me to guess the configuration below, which works. However, I don't understand why it works. Nor do I understand why there are two terminals for each switch if only one seems to be used. I suspect the clue is embedded within the text in the above image:


  The four switches, numbered S1 to S4 are connected in parallel to the
  first four (0-3) inputs


However, I do not understand what this means. Perhaps a practical example of how I would use each terminal and an explanation of why the grounding is necessary would help my understanding.
",me--,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/35079,"Read the data sheet before you start connecting to something. Your assumption that because there are nine terminals and four switches that 'each switch has two terminals' is unfounded.

The 9 terminals are 8 input channels and ground. As the text you quoted says, the switches are connected between the first four channels and ground, so the connection in your photo agrees with the schematic.

If it is because threads are nice just forget about it and do the save in main thread. If it is because your app is already multithreaded, you will have to protect accesses to the vector with mutexes to ensure that you read coherent values.

If your data is not too large and the save does not freeze the whole application, just hold the mutex all the time for the save. If this is not acceptable (for performance or User Interface reasons), only hold the mutex while copying the vector in memory to a different location, release the mutex and write asynchronously to disk.

",naser,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/21459,"
Being rich doesn't mean you are happy.
Being a successful person in life is a big challenge.
Being a doctor doesn't mean you are smart.


The sense of ""being"" at the start of a sentence depends on its context.

In all the sentences being has been used as a gerund. Being rich, being a doctor, and being a successful person are gerund clauses that are subjects of the sentences.

These sentences imply as follows:


If/when you are  rich, it doesn't mean you are happy.
If/when you are a doctor, it doesn't mean you are smart.
It is a big challenge to be a successful person in life.


You can also use to-infinitive instead of being, but the use of the to-infinitive isn't so common.

Besides, in the construct of some sentences, being is also used to express a reason or cause as an alternative to because, since, or as.  For example:

Being the youngest, Sara is her father's favourite.

To process this query without an index, every column, last_name must be checked for every row in the table (full table scan). 

With an index, you could just follow a B-tree data structure until 'Smith' was found.

With a non index the worst case looks linear (n), whereas with a B-tree it would be log n, hence computationally less expensive.

In the proposed HTML5 standard, there's the option of storing web application data in a local cache using a cache manifest. I am looking to use this technique for an offline tiled web map application and did a quick prototype here based on a standard install of Geoserver. 

I just ripped the OpenLayers client page that is generated from one of the default layers and changed the &lt;html&gt; tag to 

&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" manifest=""cache.manifest""&gt;


And created the file cache.manifest which simply reads

CACHE MANIFEST
http://lima.schaaltreinen.nl:8080/


Which should, in my limited understanding of the matter, locally cache everything that loads from that URL: all tiles and the OpenLayers JS. In fact, upon first call in Firefox, it does ask me to allow local storage, but when I hit refresh - either online or offline - the page croaks stating that the OpenLayers object is not defined. Looks like it hasn't loaded the OpenLayers JS.

Anyone successfully did a functioning offline OpenLayers-based tiled web map app? Or hints on how to investigate this further?

if yum is not configured install it by using rpm command.

Entering the below commands would help you determine the name of an NTFS partition :

# fdisk -l /dev/sdb


It is essential to load the fuse driver. The below command should help you do that :

 # modprobe fuse


Now using the below command you must build a mount point:

The following command would help you with mounting the ntfs partition :

 # mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/ntfs


This is a temporary mounting only, if you reboot your pc the mount point will be lost. To mount it permanently, you need to edit the /etc/fstab configuration file.

UPDATE 

I agree with comment below,
I did remember then that ducks are wild animals too (when I asked the question I imagined domesticated ducklings as widely pictured in media), but anyway it is interesting to know why the domesticated ducklings are yellow now. What is the reason of selection drove such coloration to young ducks or yellow pigment is just a side effect?

While I'm no expert, I would guess that the mottled yellow-brown coloring of the juveniles is, at least partially, protective coloration, just like the somewhat similar pattern on the adult female's feathers.  While it may appear conspicuous on open water, ducks in their natural habitat will often seek shelter among reeds and other vegetation, where the irregular pattern of light and shadow would create a very effective camouflage for the ducklings.

As for the all-yellow ducklings of domestic ducks, these presumably arose via elimination of the darker parts of the coloring as a result of selective breeding, perhaps as a side effect of artificial selection for the white adult plumage found in many domestic ducks today.

I initially switched from Arvixe because they were running 2.4 and PythonAnywhere's name was just too appealing. 

My application consists of two files: phones.py and phonesearch.py.  Together they are supposed to scrape craigslist for phone prices.  

I test locally in 2.7 and it runs just fine, generating an html page (celly.html) with a table and all of the prices.  When I upload it, it generates the html just fine, but refuses to to add anything to my prices list ([intprices]).  

My suspicions: (a) because it works fine locally, PythonAnywhere isn't allowing it to communicate with craigslist; or  (b) because I'm doing this like a caveman and not using a microframework, PythonAnywhere is denying me; or  (c) I am blind to my errors and I have missed something obvious.

The next part, $p^{r-1}{(1-p)}^{n-r}$ means, assuming the event of success is independent, once again, $r-1$ successes and $n-r$ failures. Consider that $(n-r) + (r-1) = (n-1)$, which is the total number of tries so far.

",Mike B.,https://stackoverflow.com/users/462347,"There are cases where a where clause on the primary key will be slower.

The simplest is a table with one row.  Using the index requires loading both the index and the data page -- two reads.  No index cuts the work in half.

That is a degenerate case, but it points to the issue -- the proportion of the rows selected.  Or, more accurately, the proportion of pages needed to resolve the query.

When the desired data is on all pages, then using an index slowed things down.  For a non primary key, this can be disastrous, when the table is bigger than the page cache and the accesses are random.

Since pages are ordered by a primary key, the worst case is an additional index scan -- not too bad.

Some databases use statistics on tables to decide when to use an index and when to do a full table scan.  Some don't.

In short, for low selectivity queries, an index will improve performance.  For high selectivity queries, using an index can result in marginally worse performance or dire performance, depending on various factors.

Detail. If $a$ is (for instance left) invertible of left inverse $c$ then $ca = 1$ so that $ca^2 = a$ which implies that $c^2 a^2 = ca = 1$, that is $c^2 b = 1$ and $b$ is invertible. If $b$ is (let's say left) invertible then $db=1$ and then $(d a) a = 1$ and $a$ is left invertible. Same for right inverse. The relation $c^2 a^2 = 1$ shows you the assertion on quadratic residue, that is, that if you are invertible and a quadratic residue, that you your inverse is also a quadratic residue.

3738,4715,question and answer 7479,2D AABBs and resolving multiple collisions,"Okay, so this is a problem I've been trying to figure out for quite some time. Mine is a 2D platformer game with a world made up of (usually) immobile tiles and mobile sprites, both of which use AABBs to represent their hitboxes. This game is NOT grid-based due to some complications with moving layers of tiles.

I can detect collisions and easily figure out the depth of the collision. I use the ""shallowest axis method"" to determine which way to resolve a collision between the sprite and the tile. If the sprite is deeper horizontally than vertically, the direction to resolve is either up or down. If the sprite is deeper vertically than horizontally, the direction to resolve is either left or right.



This is simple enough, and it works pretty well. That is, until you have a sprite colliding with more than one tile. As, by their nature, each collision has to be checked separately, different collisions may have different direction to resolve in. For example, if a sprite is trying to walk across a row of tiles, for one frame they will intersect the next tile such that the horizontal depth is shorter than the vertical depth. As the collision says ""resolve left"", it will be pushed back and will be stuck on the corner.



I've been mulling this problem over, on and off, for quite some time, and several solutions have come to me, but all have flaws. I could mark certain sides as unreachable, but without a grid-based engine, determining ""unreachability"" is remarkably complex, especially with moving layers of tiles always a possibility.

Another possible method would be to predict collisions before they happen and ""work back"" the movement to the point of the collision, I suppose, but I'm not sure how the math on that works.

I feel that I'm missing something incredibly obvious, especially since games from the 80s have already solved this problem.
",Celarix,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/34552,"You're overthinking the problem and conflating a couple of issues. But that's okay because, as you said, this is a very solved problem with lots of great answers out there.

Let's break it down:


Tilemaps. Your first example is of a sprite walking across a bunch of tiles laid out horizontally (or sliding down a wall of tiles laid out vertically, they're isomorphic). One very elegant solution to this is to simply not check the edges of tiles where we know a sprite can't get to, such as edges that are ""underground"" or edges that border another completely solid tile.  

You're right that the sprite would descend due to to gravity, then move laterally, then get stuck... but the answer is to not care about the left or right edges of the tiles that are underground. That way, your collision resolution routine only moves the sprite vertically — and your sprite can go on its merry way.

Check out the Metanet tile tutorials for a step-by-step explanation of this. You say in your question that you're not using a traditional tilemap, but that's okay too: static tiles are in the tilemap and update as above, while moving platforms and such update as #2 below.
Other AABBs. You'll only run into a problem if, in a single frame, your sprite can move a distance larger than the width/height of most AABBs in your game. If it can't, you're golden: resolve the collisions one-by-one and it'll work just fine.

If the AABBs can move very fast in a single frame then you should ""sweep"" the movement when checking for collisions: chunk up the movement into tinier fractions and check for collisions at each step.

I have lost more than 50 DVDs this way until I learned about the 3.8GB limit. Anything under 3.8GB burns fine, and DVDs burned with more than 3.8GB have usable data up to 3.8 GB, but then the remaining data is garbled, unaccessible, or the disk is just not recognized.

I'm pretty certain this is related to the replacement of cdrecord / mkisofs with wodim /genioimage (which is a problem that has been described for years). Is there another answer or fix? Re-installing cdrtools/cdrecord/mkisofs in Oneiric and Precise has become a herculean task.

3742,4719,question and answer 7487,Mechanical Equivalent of Heat,"Recently I have been looking up James Joule's experiment regarding the mechanical equivalent of heat.  After viewing some drawings of the apparatus, I assumed that the lines holding the weights would have to be attached to the drum.  They would then be allowed to fall completely through a certain distance until the lines were at full length and the mechanical motion of the fluid would have to be allowed to continue to flow, causing the weights to be pulled up a bit and drop again, oscillating up and down until the motion stopped and all of the mechanical energy from the weights would be transferred into the fluid.

However, upon watching some videos, (this video is about 14 minutes long; but, if you advance to about 5 min 30 sec, it will show the experiment in question.) I noticed that the weights were allowed to be stopped by a level surface (an external force) instead of doing what I have described above.  To me, this means the weights were still in motion and, therefore, still had KE that was not transferred into the fluid.  

Of course, the weights are moving very slowly, much more slowly than if they had been allowed to free-fall through the distance; so, their kinetic energy is very small compared to the potential energy they lost, meaning the vast majority of the potential energy was transferred into the fluid and into other, small energy losses.

Should I assume the speeds of the weights were small enough to ignore the KE in the weights?

The assumption seems to be that the potential energy lost by the falling weights was all transferred into the fluid.  However, in the experiments, the lines have to be wound back up and the weights dropped several times in order to make a measurable difference in temperature.  Each time the weights fall, they are stopped by an external force, meaning they have kinetic energy that is not transferred into the fluid after falling through a measured distance.  It seems to me that some of the potential energy from the weights is transferred into the fluid; but, some of it is transferred into the kinetic energy of the weights falling.
",Michael E. Mall,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/24443,"Only the change in kinetic energy or work done in slowing down the falling mass should be considered. The work done on the falling masses when they hit the floor or table has to be omitted because the energy involved is not transferred to the water.

[EDIT - 06/29/2012]

I believe you have your PHP OOP logic incorrect, but I could be wrong. You're defining a property in a child class which extends a parent class. You then call the parent constructor inside the child constructor. 

The code you provided shows that you assign the child class property $plugin_basename, but then you don't do anything with it after that.

I'm assuming you're trying to set a property $plugin_basename for the parent class to handle. However, if that's the case, then you need to either define the property within the parent class, OR you need to call the parent method which makes use the property $plugin_basename. 

If that's NOT the case, then you need to be sure you make use of the property $plugin_basename, within the child class, AFTER it's been assigned like so: $this-&gt;child_class_method_name($this-&gt;plugin_basename);

You could access the parent class method which handles the property $plugin_basename, and pass the property assigned by the child class to the parent class method like so: $this-&gt;parent_class_method_name($this-&gt;plugin_basename);

I'm not really too certain how you have your plugin setup, given the minimal amount of code you provided. 

If you could provide more of an idea of what you do with the property $plugin_basename, after it's been assigned, I could possibly be of more assistance.

You could make that first firewall a software one, running on the spam-filter server.

So you could have the server on the Internet network as far as the ASA is concerned.  If you have spare ports on your ASA you could just assign one to the outside network (so you have two) and connect your spam server to that.  Then create a firewall rule allowing traffic from the spam-filter server into your inside network as required.  If you don't have a spare port, you will need a switch before the ASA.

You could get more fancy using a DMZ vlan on the ASA itself, and use the ASA to firewall the spam-filter, and the inside network.  This is probably the closest to what your Sonicwall was doing.

There is also an event-listener, that listens for page-scroll and resize and checks some other constraints (like: is there already an ajax-call in progress?). This listener calls StartAJAX.

When it calls StartAJAX on a local copy of my page (file:///User/...) within Safari, I get the Ajax-content perfectly fine inserted into my html-document. within the other browsers i get the error-message inserted into the html-page. It is:


  JSON-Answer: undefined
  JSON-Errorstatus: error
  Error:


Why does it work in Safari but not in Firefox, Chrome and Opera?  

How can I make those browsers work?

(I need to test it with all browsers, because all browsers render the same html-domument differently, but I don't want to upload all files to the server after every change just to test it.)

EDIT:

After reading some answers, I want to make something clear, that I obviously did not make clear enough:

I am searching for settings in Webbrowsers


I will NOT change the settings of my remote webserver (Apache)
I will NOT manipulate any files on my remote machine (.htaccess)
I will NOT set up a webserver on my local iMac
I will NOT change the code of the AJAX-calls in my Javascript-files
I will NOT change the code of the Perl-Scripts on my remote Server


I can tell you why:

I am just doing a short maintainance, and i am too lazy to upload every manipulated file to the remote machine after I edited it. The settings of the webserver are fine for actual operation. I don't want to change them (and maybe forget the changes before finishing my work). Same for the scripts: Those parts that some of you want to change work fine as they are now. There is no reason to touch the Ajax-Calls, because there is nothing wrong with them in the productive environment.

All I want is that those stupid browsers Firefox, Opera and Chrome behave like Safari and process the Ajax-calls correctly.

BTW:

Please can anyone explain what is so risky to call data via Ajax from an other domain in Firefox, Opera or Chrome while it seems to be harmless doing the same thing in Safari?
",Hubert Schölnast,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1302716,"To avoid this issues, you should develop your page (in your local computer it's ok) using a webserver (like apache, nginx, ...), so, your url ajax calls starts with the protocol http or https, not ""file"". ""File"" is the path of your file but using SO path system, not a web server system.

In the other hand, browsers has ""Same Origin Policy"". This is a security feature but what are the ""problems"" in web development using ajax calls? Well, your ajax calls always be done to the same server, for example, if you have your web on domain ""http://my-domain.com"" then your ajax calls must be to the same domain ""http://my-domain.com"". 

To ""bypass"" SOP in ajax calls, you have three solutions:


Create a proxy on your ""my-domain.com"" that use curl (in php for example) to retrieve the data and return it to your ajax call
Use JSON-P
Allow your domain in your webserver (.htaccess for example) setting a proper configuration to CORS: http://enable-cors.org/

The problem is that D or P are being cleared somewhere (probably when they get set as a render target), so the only sprite that ""survives"" is the last one.

Since you have all your sprites rendered to D you only need to render D onto P once.

3802,4790,question and answer 7605,Lead Free Soldering and bad looking joints,"For years I've been soldering with normal Sn60Pb40 solder wire. But now I try to switch to lead free solder. In many forums over the internet I found the Amasan BF32-3 solder wire. It's a Sn95Ag4Cu solder wire with 3.5% flux. 

So I tried it and was very disappointed. Nearly every solder joint was looking different. Some of them were (partially) shiny; some (the most) of them were dull. And the worst thing was, that even with additional flux, the solder didn't flow like the leaded. So there is no way, I could solder fine pith SMD stuff with it.

I’m using a JBC soldering iron station with a C245-907 2.2mm chisel tip and tried different temperatures starting with 290°C to 360°C. The best results I get with about 315°C, with 350°C I got the worst results. I used the Amtech NC-559 Flux – the original, not the fake from china. 

Some other guys told me, that maybe the solder wire is not the best. That's why I'm looking for other soldering wires. But there are so many on market. Some with copper, some are Sn96.5Ag3.5 like the Amtech ASN96A3.5-0.50.

So can someone tell me, with what type of solder wire or what product I can get nice shiny solder joints. And yes, I now that dull joints were not a sign for a bad or even cold joint.
",user39063,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/39063,"The simple answer is get good old lead based solder wire and some flux and most chances it will be easy to get shiny looking solder joints. I have worked with many lead free solder wires at work and although they are all different, the end result is always a dull looking solder joint. Having that said - a shiny solder joint is on itself not an indication of a good bond. The shape of the solder in respect with the hole size and other geometrical parameters is (look up NASA soldering standards). The appearance of your solder joints also got to do with the cooling of the joint, how fast it cools etc. This will cause different looks and textures, not indicating anything about the electrical properties of the bond.

If you absolutely must have shiny joints try looking into solder pasts.

Click the Customize button.
On the Customize Income/Expense by Category window, on the Accounts tab, click Clear All, and add back in the account(s) you want to track.
Click Show Report.  Adjust the dates and periods to what you want (weekly, monthly, etc.)

Fire up your favorite chart-capable spreadsheet program (I used OpenOffice Calc) and paste the report in.
Now, create the change in net worth using the net worth figures.  This is just a difference from period to period.

ActionParams:

@using (Html.BeginForm(""PreLoaderView"", ""Report"", FormMethod.Post, new {
    @target = ""_blank""
}))


Controller:

public ActionResult PreLoaderView(TestViewModel viewModel) {
    return View(viewModel);
}

public ActionResult SolicitorActionReport_Load(TestViewModel viewModel) {
    var cultivationModel = new CultivationModel(viewModel, ConstituentRepository, CampaignRepository);
    var cultivationData = cultivationModel.GetCultivationActivityData();
    var reportParamModel = new List&lt;ReportParamModel&gt;
                                   {

                                   };
    return FileContentPdf(""Constituent"", ""CultivationActivityManagement"", cultivationData, reportParamModel, new List&lt;FundraisingAppealMassSummary&gt;(), new List&lt;FundraisingAppealPortfolioSummary&gt;());
    return Content(viewModel.SolicitorType);
}


PreLoaderView:

@model Report.SolicitorActionParamsViewModel

@{
    ViewBag.Title = ""Cultivation Activity"";
}
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $(function () {
        $.ajax({
            url: '@Url.Action(""SolicitorActionReport_Load"", ""Report"", @Model)',

            complete: function() {
                $('#progress').hide();
            },
            error: function() {
                alert('oops');
            }
    });
    });
&lt;/script&gt;

3842,4838,question and answer 7696,Do inner shell electrons feel the electric field/force from an outer shell electron in an atom?,"We just finished studying Gauss’ law and were puzzled by this thought. If I look at a copper atom and focus on the 29th electron in the 4th shell, according to Gauss’ law, I can draw a Gaussian surface that completely encloses the first three shells plus the nucleus. It is my understanding that the 29th electron will not contribute to the E-field inside this Gaussian because this charge is outside the Gaussian.  However, it does not mean that the 29th electron doesn’t apply an electric force on the inner electrons, especially the 3rd shell electrons. So here is my dilemma: wouldn’t this effect the E-field of the inner shell electrons?

Please, if possible, answer this question without quantum if possible.
",Lisa Lee,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/29653,"It is a misconception to think that just because the 29th electron is outside the gaussian surface, it will not have an effect on the electric field inside it. The total flux through the surface is indeed zero, but that doesn't mean there is no influence: imagine a point charge and draw up a sphere next to it. The electric field goes in on one face and out the other to make a zero flux, but there's definitely a field inside.

The situation for copper is slightly more complicated because the  electron is in a spherically symmetric s orbital. This does reduce its influence on the inner electrons, not because of Gauss's law but because of a theorem of Newton:


  the electric field due to a spherical shell of charge vanishes inside it.


However, the 4s orbital is not simply a spherical shell of charge around the [Ar] 3d10 core. Even in the most simplistic, hydrogen-based models, the higher s orbitals still have a sizable probability of being inside the core, and have multiple shells of positive probability:



 Source: Wikipedia. Note that this is a 6s hydrogen orbital with no actual relation to copper; a 4s orbital has four such spherical shells.

Because of this, the 4s electron does create a nonzero electric field inside the atomic core, and this does affect the inner electrons.



As you have guessed, of course, in real life this is much, much more complicated, and quantum chemists will send you packing if you tell them you need an accurate ab initio description of the whole copper atom all the way to the 1s2 core. The electrons are highly correlated, and all of them interact strongly with each other, including such lovely job-simplifying features like exchange interactions. Quantum mechanically, the bottom line to your question is that it's meaningless to talk about ""the 29th electron,"" because all the electrons are indistinguishable and therefore you must consider them all as a whole. (Specifically, ""the charge density due to the electron in the 4s orbital"" is not a meaningful physical quantity.)

However, the quantumness actually helps. The reason for this is clear if you try to come up with a classical model of a copper atom. Even if you preserved the shell structure with the lone 4s electron orbiting well outside them, the inner electrons will be a hugely complicated jumble of electrons whizzing around, and the system will be nowhere near spherically symmetric. While you can still draw a gaussian sphere and get information about the total flux, this does not help at all in describing the electric field at any particular point.

In the quantum case, on the other hand, everything is much simpler. You have a bunch of closed shells and a single $s$ electron, and this means that the whole atom is spherically symmetric. Electric fields must be radial and uniform, and drawing gaussian spheres does help you calculate the electric field at a given radius.

3893,4895,question and answer 7791,Implement signature-level security on Android services with more than one allowed signature,"I'm developing on an application at the moment which contains quite a lot of personal user information - things like Facebook contacts, etc ... Now, one of the things I want to be able to do (and have done, quite effectively) is open up parts of the application to ""3rd Party"" applications, using Android's build-in inter-process communication protocol (AIDL). So far so good.

Here's the catch: because we're involved in handling quite a lot of personal information, we have to be quite careful about who can and can't access it; specifically, only ""Trusted"" applications should be able to do so. So the natural way to do this is to use a custom permission within the AndroidManifest.xml file where we declare the services. My problem is this: I want to be able to enact signature-level protection (similar to the normal ""signature"" permission level), but with a bit of a catch:

I don't only want application signed with our internal signature to be able to access the services. I'd like to be able to build a list of ""trusted signatures"" &amp; at runtime (or if there's a better way, then maybe some other time?) be able to check incoming requests against this list of trusted keys.

This would satisfy the security constraints in the same way as the normal ""signature"" permission level I think - only programs on the ""trusted keys list"" would be able to access the services, and keys are hard to spoof (if possible at all?) - but with the added bonus that we wouldn't have to sign every application making use of the APIs with our internal team's key.

Is this possible at the moment in Android? And if so, are there any special requirements?

    if key == ""angleFrom"" || key == ""angleTo"" {
        return true;
    }
    return super.needsDisplayForKey(key)
}

override func actionForKey(event: String!) -&gt; CAAction!{
    if event == ""angleFrom"" || event == ""angleTo"" {
        return self.makeAnimationForKey(event)

3913,4919,question and answer 7831,Is there a name for the number of values a variable can take?,"For example, a bit or a boolean can be either 0 or 1 so the number 2 is associated with it. Similarly, for a byte which is 8 bits, the maximum number of different assignments would be 2^8.

Is there a name for this number?

When we pass everything through our system that has ECMAScript, Java and MySQL, then a boolean does not have only two possible assignments. For instance, a false boolean gets saved as a 0 and the boxed value could be null so a boolean suddenly can get true, false, 0, 1, null or even undefined or &lt;missing&gt;.

I think it could get problematic in tests to guarantee that the values are not inconsistent. For instance, a value boolean locked could become null and then when a script or a layout template evaluates it then it will evaluate to false somewhere if the real value was null and similar problems.

So why don't we always assert that a boolean has the same number of possible values (2 values) and similarly for other types?

There is a mathematical term named ""arity"" that is something similar but not exactly, and statistics and probability theory also has the concept of ""event space"" that would be almost exactly what I mean. For instance, the event space for a boolean would be the set {0,1} which has cardinality 2 and that cardinality doesn't get preserved throughout the system, especially when data is passed as polyglots and/or serialized (json, jsonp, xml, yaml).
",Niklas Rosencrantz,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/12893,"I would call it cardinality (and indeed I have used it in that sense). It is strictly the cardinality of the set of all values a variable can take.

Edit: for example, a 16-bit integer can take exactly 65536 values. The cardinality of the set of all values that the integer can take is 655536.

Once you start to consider variables that have a range of valid values and also a range of invalid values (like a boolean with a bitwise value of 17), then you have to extend the concept somewhat, but you can still describe those values with set notation and the concept of cardinality still applies.

Edit: Yes, this is the mathematical set, not programming Set. If you were to apply the concept to the C# type short and derive the type short?, this would not have 65537 values, represented by the union of the set of 65536 values mentioned previously and one additional value, null.

3920,4928,question and answer 7847,How do you deal with amends from a client?,"I'm a web designer currently working with a very demanding client.

I presented them with designs back in May and I'm still working through amends with them. They are making changes to everything and although I know amends are to be expected, it's really getting to be frustrating. I'm currently working every evening on the list of new amends they have. Tiny things like ""make this blue"" or ""change the width of this"" or ""make this gap smaller"".

I know amends need to be made and that's fine, but how do you handle when there are just too many? I've counted the comments on inVision and there have been 185 amends on 6 pages of a website design. 

Some of them change, and then change again, and then change again and again. For example they wanted to add a strapline, so I added it, adjusted all the menus to accomodate is across the 6 pages. Then they wanted to change the text, so I changed it and updated it across all 6 documents. Now that it's changed, they want to make the menu smaller so now I have to go back and change the menu again.

I quoted based on time I thought it would take to complete the designs with some time for amends but I've more than tripled the time. I haven't explained to them early enough in the process that amends beyond the normal would cost them more so I'm going to have to swallow the cost this time, but should I lay this out better with future clients?

How do you handle amends? Do you put an estimated time on them at the beginning, and then charge more if they go over this? Or do you do something different?
",user1486133,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/46171,"Work is work. You need to get paid for work. Whether it was part of the initial proposal or added on afterwards, you need to bill for it. This also keeps the client in line. If they are being billed for every change, they start to prioritize their changes.

When you set up your initial agreement with the client, definitely account for a period of revisions. Perhaps you may say ""estimate includes 10 hours of revisions"". 

You then need to stick with that and if it goes beyond 10 hours, bill accordingly. This is typically handled with a clause ala ""revisions beyond the 10 hour allotment will be billed at the standard hourly rate of $xxx"".

Post-launch, changes typically have to be documented a bit more formally and you want to use something called a change request. A change request is essentially a mini-project with it's own analysis phase and estimate that the client agrees to before work commences.

Moreover the more math you know the faster you will be able to understand the results google/se/wiki gives you, and the less you'll need to drill down to understand what people tell you. In the process of solving your programming problems you'll end up learning math anyway but if you focus on math it will be a far more efficient process.

Slightly more complicated answer - When mathematicians and programmers use the word ""solution"" (for problems, that is, not equations - ie not ""roots"") - they mean pretty much the same thing. Learning to solve math problems helps you to learn to solve programming problems.

BTW - and no offense intended to anybody whatsoever - anybody who says s/he is a good programmer but s/he hates math is a Big Fat Liar.

 regarding the representation of negative integers and operations on them? 2's complement, maybe? 

Asking as a programmer/user: Are there any assumptions I can safely make when performing bit-level operations on negative integers?
",repeat,https://stackoverflow.com/users/4609915,"Strictly speaking these are two different questions:


Actual physical representation: this isn't visible at the Prolog level, and therefore the standard quite rightly has nothing to say about it.  Note that many Prolog systems have two or more internal representations (e.g. two's complement fixed size and sign+magnitude bignums) but present a single integer type to the programmer.
Results of bitwise operations: while the standard defines these operations, it leaves much of their behaviour implementation defined.  This is a consequence of (a) not having a way to specify the width of a bit pattern, and (b) not committing to a specific mapping between negative numbers and bit patterns.


This not only means that all bitwise operations on negative numbers are officially not portable, but also has the curious effect that the result of bitwise negation is totally implementation-defined (even for positive arguments):  Y is \1 could legally give -2, 268435454, 2147483646, 9223372036854775806, etc. All you know is that negating twice returns the original number.

For extra complications see ""XACT_ABORT"" (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/ms188792.aspx) &amp; other transaction behaviour controlling options, and look into TRY/CATCH (added in SQL2005) for more flexible exception handling.

You can insert/update multiple tables at once while looking like you are updating a simple single object by using views with INSTEAD OF triggers (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175521.aspx) - essentially you define a view that merges the data from the tables as needed and create a trigger that handles the complications of insert and update operations (translating actions upon the view into actions upon the base tables (and potentially others)).

If you consider the individual stores in a partitioned tables to be separate entities then this can fit the description of a single operation on (what looks like) a single object affecting many tables at once.

This is of course fairly generic information: for something more specific you'll need to describe much more precisely in your question what you are trying to achieve (and why, which may be relevant for suggesting alternatives). As it stands your question may be closed for being too vague.

I've recently noticed that when this ""running water"" sound occurs that it is more prominent when the engine is running faster (e.g. during acceleration).  This leads me to believe maybe this has something to do with the water pump, or some other liquid pump, that is run by the engine and not moving enough liquid to fill the pipe, hence a sloshing / running water sound.

",meltdownmonk,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/4883,"It depends -- on the lube you use, the type of riding you do, and how much of a maintenance nut you are.


The ""drier"" the lube you use, the cleaner the chain will stay (though ""dry"" lube does not protect as well against moisture).
If you ride on roads, and rarely ride in the rain or slop, you need less chain maintenance.
Some people have to have their chains spotless, others can tolerate a bit of grime.  Keeping the chain spotless probably adds 5-10% (over ""moderate"" maintenance) to chain and sprocket life (though you can overdo it and actually make things worse).  But that extra 5-10% life is not that significant.


One important thing to do, after lubing, is to use a rag to wipe the outside of the chain.  This removes a lot of grime and also removes excess lube that will attract more grime.

  Amanda just poured herself a cup of hot coffee to get her day started.

That means that a complete set of 9 can't be completed for two of the sets in the game. A player can call a corner while holding 8 cards if he willing to gamble that the 9th is out of play. After corner is called, check to see if the 9th is in the widow. If it is, the score is as normal. If it's not, the person holding it gets a bonus (+20) and the person calling the false corner gets a penalty (-20). 

We always played with spoons. In the middle of the table, one fewer spoons than the number of players. Once somebody gets a corner he quietly picks up one spoon. As they notice, other players pick one up until there are none left, leaving one player out. Everyone with a spoon gets 20 points. Note that it's excellent form to continue to pretend to trade after you've picked up your spoon, leaving the unobservant desperately trying to improve his hand while everyone else snickers behind their cards.

How it can help SEO is when you have a dedicated page(s) for each tag that page will be naturally optimized for that keyword. That page will (theoretically) potentially rank well for it. That page can then drive traffic and potential link givers to pages tagged with that keyword. Also, the interlinkng by your pages will help to increase each page's PR as well as boost each other's rankings due to the advantages of anchor text and everything else incoming links have to offer.

4005,5034,question and answer 8011,Is hacking back a valid security technique for companies?,"Recently it has come to light through the reverse engineering of hacking tools that there are vulnerabilities in them that could be exploited to take over an attackers computer during a remote hacking session. In other words, while they are hacking you, you could get into the system from which they are launching the attack to find out what they have managed to access, what the system is, or even p4wn it yourself. The goals would be damage control, deterrence, and ultimately being able to charge the perpetrator of the crime. 

Leaving aside the many legal, ethical, and moral considerations (if you are curious there's a debate recorded here), my question is whether hacking back using this technique has any value to a company. If it was ethical and legal would it be worth a company to invest in the systems and skills needed to make this work, or is it a waste of money? 

EDIT:
There's been several comments regarding leaving the legal and ethical considerations out of the question, so here's the explanation behind that. So far the discussion of hacking back in this manner has been discussed by lawyers, some shouting it is legal, and others saying it isn't. What they do agree on is that there's no case law, and until there is there will be no clear answer. Also, legalities vary from nation to nation, so the answer to legality is ""maybe"" and ""it depends where you are"". 

However so far none of the discussion I've seen has been among IT Security professionals who would be the ones to design, deploy, and run systems that would to the hacking back. The lawyers all seem to think that organizations would adopt the technique as a matter of course, but I am not in agreement with that and I would like to hear the views of my peers.

If the attack becomes serious and you need to go to court; evidence that you ""striked back"" would not look good and could work against you.  if you are going to spend money in this topic then spend it on forensic tools so that it strengthens any legal action

Let M be a n-D manifold and $\dot x=F(x)u_1, F\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}, x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}, u_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be a control system evolving on M (F is the system matrix i.e. state transition function, and $u_1$ is the input of the system. For all practical purposes $u_1$ is an m-vector from an input space $\mathbb{R}^{m}$). Now let $x=\Psi (y)$ be a coordinate change on M and $u_2=M(y)u_1$ a transformation of the input $u_1$ of the first system. By applying these maps on the system, you get the new equations  $\dot y=F(y)u_2$. As you may notice, F is the same in both systems. The problem is why is this happening i.e. for what systems and transformations does this property hold?

A little more elaboration

It is useful to investigate the maps more closely. In the general case one has

$\dot x=D\Psi \dot y$
$\dot x= F(x)u_1$

thus
$\dot y=D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1$, (1)

where $D\Psi$ is the Jacobian matrix of $\Psi$. In our case it actually turns out that:  

$\dot y=F(y)M(y)u_1$. (2)

You can then consider that $u_2=M(y)u_1$ and get the final system,

$\dot y=F(y)u_2$,

that is, the same system.
 By (1),(2) you get,

$D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1=F(y)M(y)u_1 \Rightarrow (D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)-F(y)M(y))u_1=0$. 

Since this holds for every $u_1$, you have the condition,

$F(\Psi (y))=D\Psi F(y)M(y)$

So, what does this condition imply? What systems F and maps $\Psi$ hold this property (of system invariance)? I should note that F is nonlinear and a case study where this actually happens is the kinematic model of a unicycle robot i.e. this. Any ideas?
",Jorge,https://mathoverflow.net/users/19928,"This is not a surprising fact for driftless systems to have symmetries. In our previous work we considered only nonlinear systems with drift and classified the symmetries accordingly. In case of a driftless system
\dot x=F(x)u you can interpret $F$ (that's what it is) as a distribution of vector fields $f_1, \dots, f_m$ (column vectors of the matrix) and whenever such distribution is involutive ($[f_i, f_j]=\lambda_1(x)f_1+\cdots+\lambda_m(x)f_m$ then necessarily the system admits nontrivial symmetries (this is due to the Frobenius Theorem). That's the case you have here with the unicycle with $f_1=(\cos \theta, \sin \theta, 0), f_2=(0,0, 1)$. I can write in more extensive way but I hope you would get the idea from there.

4017,5054,question and answer 8039,Piezo as a switch to flash an led when disturbed,"An LED embedded in a small translucent item (say half the size of a pack of cards) that would flash on briefly if the object was disturbed or tipped over.
I immediately responded that a piezoelectric sensor/generator inside the object wired to an LED would do it.
However, when I tried to demonstrate this concept using a piezo buzzer I liberated from an old phone, I could only get the LED to register a dim blip when I smashed the piezo buzzer with a blunt object.
How would I ensure that a piezo sensor/generator would actually light up the LED adequately without the application of blunt force trauma.
As I mentioned, space would be an issue so no large parts, breadboards, or really complex circuitry.
I'm just trying to figure out the easiest and smallest way to accomplish this simple task.
Thanks a lot for any help you can give me!
",Rory O'Hare,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/6179,"A tilt sensor would probably do. All the large component vendors stock varying types of these.

A simple DIY solution might be something like a small spring (from a pen?) placed around a stiff wire so any disturbance causes the spring to contact the wire and close the circuit (connections at bottom of spring and wire like a SPST switch) 

The above would obviously need a small battery/solar cell/energy harvesting solution of some sort. If you are trying to do this without a battery then I don't think it's possible with a piezo, as they only produce tiny amounts of current. A shake to charge torch type circuit might be made to work (e.g. magnet slides through coil on tilt)  

EDIT - With the requirement of no battery now confirmed, I think I would try the coil idea mentioned above. If all you need is a brief flash then when the thing is tilted and the magnet slides through the coil it should work, You can downsize as necessary (within reason)

4019,5057,question and answer 8042,What is the best way for a user to select an item by unique identifier?,"My team and I are building a mobile app where the user will need to input a human-readable unique identifier (the serial number) of a single unit of inventory. Our system tracks the serial numbers that the user can access. We have considered three possible input modes:

1. We show the user the entire list of serial numbers they can access and allow him to select one from the list (like how a select element would work on an HTML page).

Pros:


The user doesn't have to type anything in.
The user can't enter an invalid serial number.


Cons:


The list is likely to be overwhelmingly large.
The serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.
Data usage for downloading the entire list of serial numbers


2. We allow the user to start entering the serial number in a text input and have an auto-suggest drop-down with a filtered list of serial numbers the user can access.

Pros:


The user doesn't have to type in a complete serial number.
The user is unlikely to enter an invalid serial number.
Smaller list to choose from than Option 1.


Cons:


The serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.
Auto-suggest may have limited value since the unit has a barcode that we could read.
Data usage for downloading a sizable list of serial numbers


3. We require the entire serial number to be entered, and once we recognize the correct number of characters, we validate the serial number against the user's accessible list and show feedback.

Pros:


The unit has a barcode that we could read, so this has the potential to be simpler than an auto-suggest or select-from-list paradigm.
Simpler implementation
Significantly reduced data usage vs. Option 1 and Option 2


Cons:


The unit has multiple barcodes, so it might take a couple of tries for the user to capture the correct one.
Typing manually would be tedious if the camera is unavailable or barcode scanner isn't working for whatever reason (lighting, etc.)


Which of these three is the best approach? Is there a better approach than what we have considered?
",Nick Saunders,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/50391,"Well, if you can do this using barcode OR manual input, and you say serial numbers are sequential, so both teh barcode AND teh serial numbers will have common characters, you can do something like this:

1- Offer the user to scan the barcode (include some hint message)
   1.1 - If user scans barcode
      1.1.1 - on success --&gt; stop
      1.1.2 - on failure --&gt; goto 2
2- Offer the user to manually input the value. Here you can ask to enter barcode or SN number. Strip all common elements and ask your user to input the values that are not common. 
    2.1- If sequentially generated series: ask to enter the last 3, 4, 5 numbers (based on the pattern structure of your serial number)
    2.2- If barcode number, you'll have quite some common numbers. For example, on UPC based barcodes, you'll probably need to ask for the last 4 numbers
3- Validate and provide instant feedback
    3.1 - If correct, stop process and display success message
    --else
    3.2 - Ask user to correct input, go to 3

I'm totally confused by this. My thought is that the online balance is what the bank believes I have in the bank. But I really don't know how much money I have right now. Is it 3,000 or is it 600? I mean that's a really large gap there.

I also read somewhere that if you have duplicate transactions in your Q2008 you should delete them. Does either the 2008 or 2010 edition have support for this, and how do you go about using it to iron out the errors in your account (if they are indeed errors...)
",leeand00,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/77,"While I don't use Quicken (yet &ndash; though I am considering it) I'd trust the online balance, i.e. the balance reported by your bank.  The other ending balance is calculated by Quicken based on transactions it has in its database.  There are at least a couple of likely reasons why there may be a discrepancy:


Data errors:  If you do have extraneous or missing transactions, it could throw off the Quicken balance until they're corrected.  I use Microsoft Money and monitor my transactions carefully and I won't change that practice if I switch to other software.  When it comes to financial software:  ""trust, but verify.""  Not only do the financial software people have to get it right &ndash; so does your bank!  Perhaps I'm jaded; my first experience downloading transactions didn't go very well :-)
Timing: Another possible discrepancy is that your bank's online balance may be reflecting transactions that are pending.  For instance, I've noticed before that my credit card ""available balance"" as reported online by my financial institution reflected some charges that were authorized but not yet posted to the account.  It is especially noticeable when there's a large charge.  If your bank ""knows about"" transactions that are not yet posted, it might reflect the expected amounts in your online balance, whereas Quicken would have no transaction detail yet so it would be unable to factor them into the calculation of the ending balance.


I can't comment on the specific features in 2008 or 2010 with regards to duplicate transactions, but perhaps someone else can comment on that part of your question.

Would adding magic 'weapons' that could add enhancement bonuses and magic weapon effects to a monk's unarmed strikes be sufficient to re-balance them? Would they then be over-balanced?

",Paul Hutton,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/2689,"Necessary but insufficient

It would help. It would more than help; I have a hard time imagining them being functional without it. The necklace of natural attacks or scorpion kama are generally necessary for Monks. That said, the necklace of natural attacks does exist (as do similar items in Pathfinder), and it&rsquo;s not nearly enough to make the Monks good.

The Monk&rsquo;s problems are problems of design: the people who wrote it evidently had no clear idea of what a Monk was or should do. Thus it receives a mish-mash of random abilities that do not synergize (and frequently contradict one another, see Flurry of Blows and Fast Movement).

To &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the Monk, one must first come up with a clear vision of what the Monk is supposed to be and do, and then most likely rebuild it from the ground up focused on that vision.

Or simply use one of the many classes that can effectively model one or more possible visions of what a &ldquo;monk&rdquo; should do, without any levels in the &ldquo;Monk&rdquo; class. The Cleric and Psychic Warrior are both Open Game Content and quite capable of fulfilling most roles you could imagine for the Monk, for instance. I&rsquo;d argue that it&rsquo;s entirely reasonable to treat a Barbarian&rsquo;s Rage as &ldquo;Zen Focus&rdquo; and waive the non-lawful requirement (which I&rsquo;d further argue is dumb to begin with). Such a &ldquo;Barbarian&rdquo; multiclassed with Fighter for combat maneuver mastery and perhaps taking Improved Unarmed Strike would make a decent monk.

4048,5091,question and answer 8098,"With estimates of mass constraints on magnetic monopoles, how likely is one to be found by the LHC(MoEDAL)?","Fermilab seems to have ruled out monopoles with mass less than 850 GeV, but I have seen some estimates of the mass thought to be in the order of up to $10^{18}$ GeV, which, of course, would make them undetectable in any accelerators. By 2013, the LHC is scheduled to reach up to 14 TeV. The only disputed sighting of a cosmic ray produced magnetic monopole was in 1982 when Blas Cabrera reported discovering one (Valentine event monopole). This has never been duplicated. CERN has set up the Monopole and Exotics Detector MOEDAL. Other experiments set up to detect them are the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna--ANITA, and the Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detection Array, aka AMANDA. While both of these detected neutrinos, neither detected magnetic monopoles (looking for Cerenkov radiation produced by products of monopole interaction).
Another method of detection is to look for induced current in a superconducting ring when a monopole passes through.
Joseph Polchinski called the existence of monopoles “one of the safest bets that one can make about physics not yet seen.” This shows some optimism on his part that one will be seen. Is there any reason or way to limit the mass of the monopole on the upside to 14 TEV or less?
",Gordon ,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/1495,"Dear Gordon, Polchinski didn't imply anything about the lightness of the monopoles. You are overinterpreting what he said: his statement was an in-principle statement by a theorist. Just to be sure, the MoEDAL collaboration has overinterpreted him, too: he has never suggested that an experiment of their kind will find the beast. Still, it's very important to know whether such qualitatively different particles exist even if we think it's very likely that they won't be directly detected in the near (or far) future. Most of the top contemporary state-of-the-art theoretical physics deals with objects that will probably never be detected by direct experiments, for obvious financial and technological limitations.

Directly experimentally, the lower bound on the mass is just 500 GeV or so, but when some theory is wisely added, the mass is pretty much required to be exponentially higher than the TeV scale. In particular, some kind of unification seems necessary to allow the magnetic monopoles, and unification such as GUT can only appear at very high scales, such as the GUT scale of $10^{16}$ GeV: that's where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ may be embedded in a larger group that allows a topologically nontrivial solution (the $SU(2)$ of the weak interactions is not enough - it doesn't contain the hypercharge which has to be twisted as well). So it's unlikely that direct detection succeeds. Inflation has probably diluted the concentration of those massive magnetic monopoles to a very tiny number.

4049,5092,question and answer 8099,Vixion IRUX Tablet battery will not charge,"I bought this tablet recently in Tenerife.  Can find no information about the manufacturer.  

Now the battery will not charge through the mains adapter. It did charge at first.  However, I have found it does charge through USB connection to my PC.
When it charged previously a light at the connector would be red.  When it was not charging it would be green.  It is red while USB connected. 

Also it tells me now that it is charging, but if I remove the USB connection it stops charging. It has a screen showing battery condition in the form of a graph.  I could see the graph of battery % decreasing gradually.  A few days ago there was a sudden drop as if some App had used a lot of power.  

I decided to remove all Apps and did a factory reset.  This made no difference regarding the failure to charge. I have tried shutting down completely (hold the off button for a while and it asks if I want to power off)  

This made no difference.
Any advice please?

Edit #1: Thanks ce4 for your response. The charger is stated to be 5v and when I check it with a voltmeter, it shows 5.2v. Also I have tried pushing the plug into the tablet to varying amounts and makes no difference. Another point maybe I didn't make clear is that when I connect with USB only, the light does not come on but the device tells me it is charging.

But when I connect the power supply as well, the light comes on red as if indicating charging. But when I remove the USB leaving the power supply connected, the light goes back to green and is not charging from the power supply.

Despite apparently charging on USB, the percentage of battery left charged has not yet increased from 10%. I understand that USB cannot deliver high current. It appears you are right - something wrong with the charger - maybe it is not the correct one for this model - I guess it needs to be able to deliver power at a higher current level?

",Spencer,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2442463,"Personally, the cleanest approach to take is to define a class for the object signature you're expecting to take in:

class Entity {
    public he_ident { get;set; }

Then just call DeserializeObject() into a collection:

var entities = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;List&lt;Entity&gt;&gt;(json2);


You should be able to access that then just like any C# object:

foreach(var entity in entities) {

This won't work if your JSON signature is dynamic though (or will be a bit tedious, as you'd have to define classes for each of your signatures).

But personally, I find that this approach does away with the muckiness that stuff like ArrayList had, and introduces strict typing into your code, which I find to generally lend itself to stronger, cleaner structure in a C# environment.

4066,5111,question and answer 8129,How to pass alias through sudo,"I have an alias that passes in some parameters to a tool that I use often.  Sometimes I run as myself, sometimes under sudo.  Unfortunately, of course, sudo doesn't recognise the alias.

Does anyone have a hint on how to pass the alias through?

In this case, I have a bunch of options for perl when I'm debugging:

alias pd='perl -Ilib -I/home/myuser/lib -d'


Sometimes, I have to debug my tools as root, so, instead of running:

pd ./mytool --some params


I need to run it under sudo.  I've tried many ways:

sudo eval $(alias pd)\; pd ./mytool --some params
sudo $(alias pd)\; pd ./mytool --some params
sudo bash -c ""$(alias pd)\; pd ./mytool --some params""
sudo bash -c ""$(alias pd); pd ./mytool --some params""
sudo bash -c eval\ ""$(alias pd)\; pd ./mytool --some params""
sudo bash -c eval\ ""'$(alias pd)\; pd ./mytool --some params'""


I was hoping for a nice, concise way to ensure that my current pd alias was fully used (in case I need to tweak it later), though some of my attempts weren't concise at all.  My last resort is to put it into a shell script and put that somewhere that sudo will be able to find.  But aliases are soooo handy sometimes, so it is a last resort.

IDE is a parallel bus used primarily inside computers to communicate with disk drives.  It is carried on ribbon cables 2-3 inches wide.

SATA is the replacement for IDE.  It is high speed serial, so uses a lot fewer wires.

PCI is the bus you physically plug I/O cards into in a PC.  These are the cards with the tall thin metal faces that provide connections out the back via the ""I/O slots"".

People don't want to edit questions and mess with someone else's reputation (quite rightly, IMO - how would you feel getting a downvote for something added to your answer that you didn't write?).

One idea to get towards that goal would be to have a community answer on each question, with say a small reputation bump (2 points?) for participating in making it. To prevent reputation inflation, you can only get the 2 points from a given question one time, with a daily limit (say 10 points) for doing it on questions asked by others.

Then when the question is seen for posterity, it will be the first answer.

",Yishai,https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/130225,"My goodness, what fortuitous timing.  I'd been thinking about asking about this very thing.

Besides parsing HTML and working with datetimes, the most frequent question in php seems to be about the mail function.  For the uninitiated, the built-in mailing function is terribly unreliable and provides no feedback when things go wrong.  Combine this with the average quality of shared hosting, and it's no wonder why we get so many questions about sending mail through PHP.

Thankfully there is a known, finite set of solutions to these mailing problems. Many are solved by the various anti-spam techniques documented on Jeff Atwood's well-known blog post about mail deliverability.  Many are solved by using one of a handful of modern third-party mailing libraries instead of the built-in function.

Because there are so many duplicates, it's hard to actually find a good enough duplicate to suggest a closure.  So I was thinking that writing a definitive guide covering the most frequent problems might serve a worthwhile purpose.

Such things have been tried before, like ""Reference - What does this symbol mean in PHP?"", but with mixed success.

I think that spreading the word that such a resource exists might be problematic, followed closely by making sure that questions actually get closed as duplicates when they fit the pattern.  While knowledge would spread slowly throughout frequent contributors, I'm actually far more worried about dupe closures.  Some users don't care for having their questions closed as dupes, and some users think that they are special snowflakes that are totally asking a different question for which the answer is still the same.

The image on the left is what I see on my monitor ( CMYK Vector )
The image on the right was produced using flexography for a packaging design


The image on the right is dull and murky and doesn't 'pop' as much as it should. I think the yellow is the issue. Is it a possibility that my printer is at fault? Could I ask them to increase the % of yellow?

Would a matte or glossy finishing technique help?

OR is the design itself the issue with too many gradients making it hard to accurately reproduce through print?
",Cool Brian,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/30296,"What you see on your monitor is RGB. Yes, it's a CMYK file, and it's likely trying to compensate, but it's still using an RGB model.

As such, what you see on screen is usually always more vibrant/saturated than what CMYK can produce. This is due to the reproducible colors being different in each color space: 



Using coated paper and/or applying a top-coat can certainly help your CMYK print look brighter, but ultimately, you are at the mercy of what CMYK can do. 

At this point, you need to talk to your printer and get their feedback. They may be able to tweak the file to accommodate. Alternatively, if it is yellow that is the issue, perhaps they can swap Y for a more vibrant Pantone Spot Yellow.

These are n-channel FETs, but now I need a p-channel FET.  I tried to find one Mouser and Digikey, but was unsuccessful.  Is there such a thing?

It would basically be a MOSFET and a diode in one package.  Other things like over-current and over-temperature protection would also be nice, but are less important.
",mccoyn,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/7808,"The overvoltage clamp is not an ESD protection, it is a protection against an overly high input voltage during use, preventing the transistor from being turned on if too high a voltage is being applied.  

The clamp will change the transistor from being switched on to being switched off electronically in case it detects overvoltage. It does not remove the voltage, only prevent a current from flowing. Sufficient ESD will still destroy the transistor. 

The whole protection part can only be constructed for n-channel FETs, and not for p-channel FETs for technical reasons: 

The protection circuits have to be powered. We need protection only when conductive, because that is when heat is created inside the transistor. When conductive, the source-drain voltage probably is quite low. So the only way to draw power is from gate. 

Now a pfet has no voltage on gate when conductive, meaning an active protection cannot be powered. 

Also, in amplifiers, where pfets are often used, it is a bad idea to use individually protected transistors. The protection circuits are not very precise, meaning the individual transistors will not turn off at the same time. Turning off only one transistor of a symmetric setup can lead to very bad results.

But the plural form of the acronym (\acp) appends an s but this is much to small in my opinion, and looks off.

Should I try to fix this or this typographically accepted? I was thinking about a new command \DLLs (and \DLL) which added a normal 's' but that just feels dirty.
",Davy Landman,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/794,"According to the answer to this question: Plurals (from The Chicago Manual of Style Online), an acronym should be treated as a word with its own meaning, so (extrapolating) the ""s"" indicating plural should have the size of the lower-case ""s"" corresponding to the font size of the acronym. 

Invoking the smaller option for the acronym package results in typesetting the acronym using \textsmaller from the relsize package. The ""s"" indicating the plural form will have the size of the lower-case ""s"" with \textsmaller, so I think that the right option would be to leave the size of the ""s"" as it is. Furthermore, increasing the size for the ""s"" could result in confusion if the size of the ""s"" is too close to the size of the singular form of the acronym.

However, if you really want to change the size of the ""s"" indicating plural forms , you need to redefine the internal commands \AC@aclp, and \AC@acsp. The simplest way to achieve this is to patch those commands through the etoolbox package. A little example, in which the ""s"" will have size given by \normalsize:

Why is this happening? And is there a way to prevent it from happening? I thought ext4 was meant to be resistant to fragmentation. Instead I find that it immediately fragments a solitary file when all the rest of the volume is unused. This seems to be worse than both FAT32 and NTFS.
",EmmaV,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/85900,"3 or 4 fragments in a 900mb file is very good.  Fragmentation becomes a problem when a file of that size has more like 100+ fragments.  It isn't uncommon for fat or ntfs to fragment such a file into several hundred pieces.

You generally won't see better than that at least on older ext4 filesystems because the maximum size of a block group is 128 MB, and so every 128 MB the contiguous space is broken by a few blocks for the allocation bitmaps and inode tables for the next block group.  A more recent ext4 feature called flex_bg allows packing a number of ( typically 16 ) block groups' worth of these tables together, leaving longer runs of allocatable blocks but depending on your distribution and what version of e2fsprogs was used to format it, this option may not have been used.

You can use tune2fs -l to check the features enabled when your filesystem was formatted.

trough  (short o,  gh pronounced f),
thought (short o,  silent gh),
though  (long o,   silent gh),
through (oo,          silent gh),
tough   (short u,  gh pronounced f).
",JimM,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/11894,"There are at least five ways to pronounce ough:


tough, enough (rhymes with cuff)
through (rhymes with blue)
trough, cough (rhymes with off)
ought, bought (rhymes with caught)
bough (rhymes with cow)


As for the rules, the only one I can think of is that the pronunciation found in thought only happens with the ough is followed by a ""t"". Other than that, there's really no way to tell by looking at the word. 

I remember the first time I met someone with the last name of Gough. I didn't know if it was pronounced as ""go"", ""goff"", ""guff"", or ""gow"" (that last one rhyming with ""now,"" not ""know""). 

English has many letter combinations like this; consider:


earth vs hearth
now vs low
eight vs height
food vs blood
pint vs lint


to name but a few. Some words (like bow and wind) have vowels that can be pronounced two different ways, depending on the meaning of the word, leading to some ambiguous sentences, like this one:


  He took a bow as he gave her a bow.

I can understand that passwords are stored as salted hashes in good systems so even if the passwords are discovered on the db you cant use them to login.

Is that pretty much it? 

Before we talk about password reset - in this case a good system cannot remind you of your password as it is not recoverable! It can only reset it for you and again isn't this sent plaintext over the net ??? So why cant that get stolen..

The issue is when the real plain text passwords are known by anyone or any system other than the user then identity is lost.

RPi would only recognize the first partition. 

So, I tried creating the partitions using the raspberrypi. Here are my surprising findings:

root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# fdisk -l

First, /dev/sda is NOT recognized correctly! This disk is 500GB. 

Second, mounting /dev/sda2 is not possible:

root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# mount -t ext4 /dev/sda2 /media/usbhdd1/
mount: special device /dev/sda2 does not exist
# although fdisk -l showed this device !


Third, trying to format the disk, it really sees only the sectors until 320GB:
When I start fdisk I am warned:

Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x6784fc4b.
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite)

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!

Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
Syncing disks.


I have other USB hard drives with 320GB and they really mount fine. 


Is this a limitation of RPi? Or a problem with this specific Hard Drive?   
How can I use this large disk with my RPi? 


update: solved the issue with help of the commentators here...

here is what I did ...


I thought I have some weired issue with Debian Wheezy &amp; gparted. So, I reformatted the hard drive to NTFS. Before that I ERASED the partition table. 
And created a new single NTFS partition. 
Bingo! RPi, identified the partition. However, it claimed my Drive is now 2TB big, and recommended I will use GPT:

whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

conclusion (?)

My guess is that gparted in Debian Wheezy includes some nasty bug which is sometimes showing it's ugly face. I would report a bug if I had more solid evidence. But ... since I have only one 500GB hard drive, and I don't want to
risk the health of this hard drive reformatting it so many time, I will settle this with it. If you happen to bump into this post, and you have had similar problems with large SATA drives and partitioning on wheezy, I would be happy to know.

4165,5232,question and answer 8316,How to deploy OSGi bundle to Maven repo with deploy:deploy-file?,"I have an OSGi bundle that was built using Maven by another team. The POM file declares its packaging as ""bundle"" and uses the Apache Felix plugin.

I need to deploy this artifact to a local Maven repository (Nexus) so that it can be used by our internal projects.

I have used the deploy:deploy-file target to deploy the bundle to the repository, just as you would with a standard JAR file and this works without error. I extracted the embedded POM from the bundle and passed that on the command line, so the command line was:

mvn deploy:deploy-file -Dfile=3rdpartybundle.jar -DpomFile=pom.xml -DrepositoryId=internal -Durl=http://internalserver/nexus


The issue is that when I deploy it like this, the packaging is set to bundle and as a result the name of the artifact in the repository ends up with a .bundle extension, instead of a .jar extension.

Now, we cannot figure out how to declare it as a dependency. If we declare it like this:

        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;...&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;...&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;...&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;type&gt;bundle&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;


We get an error stating that the dependency cannot be resolved. The interesting thing is that the GAV coordinates in the error message actually has ""jar"" as the value for the type of the dependency even though we set it as ""bundle"".

If we change the dependency to:

        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;...&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;...&lt;/artifactId&gt;

            &lt;type&gt;jar&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;


We get the exact same unresolved dependency error.

So how are you supposed to deploy an artifact packaged as a bundle to a Maven repository, so that it can be used as a compile time dependency for another project?

2) Try using  mvn deploy:deploy-file with -DgeneratePom=false -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/3rdpartybundle.jar but without specifying -DpomFile= - hope there's no META-INF/maven/pom.xml inside the 3rdpartybundle.jar - it should work using this but you'll need to specify the groupId/artifactId/version parameters as these won't be derived from the project's pom.

I know I've build bundle artifacts in the past and deployed these to our nexus (v1.9.0.1) and those in the Spring repo are typed bundle too, but don't recall any issue. (Incidentally you don't need to specify the bundle in dependency declarations, AFAIK if it's the only artifact it should be inferred)

  If you have a single threaded application that runs on a PC with a quadcore processor then does a .net program use all four processors?


No, it can’t, at least not simultaneously. However, it’s theoretically possible that the operating system’s scheduler first executes your thread on one processor and later moves it to another processor. Such a scheduler is necessary to allow simultaneously running more applications / threads than there are physical processors present: execution of a thread is sliced into small pieces, which are fed to the processor(s) one after the other. Each threads gets some time slice allocated during which it can calculate before usage of the CPU switches to another thread.


  Do you have any control of this as a developer?


Not directly. What you can control is the priority of your thread to make it more important to the task scheduler.

On a more general note, you should not use threads in your use-case – at least not directly. Threads are actually pretty low-level primitives. For your specific use-case, there’s a component called BackgroundWorker which abstracts many of the low-level details of thread management for you.


  If you have a multi threaded application (say four threads) on a quadcore processor then does each thread execute on different cores?


Not necessarily; again, the application has next to no control over how exactly its threads are executed; the operating system however tries really hard to schedule threads “smartly”. This means that in practice, if your application has several busy threads, they are spread out as evenly as possible across the available cores. In particular, if there are no more threads than cores then each thread gets its own core.

Hydrophobia as a rare presentation of Cotard's syndrome: a case report.1

Cotard's syndrome itself is a bizarre psychiatric condition that the authors of the above paper define well:


  Cotard’s syndrome is a rare condition where the central symptom is a nihilistic delusion, which, in its complete form, leads the patient to deny his own existence and that of the external world.


The patient described in this case report harbored delusions that his internal organs were shrinking. He asserted that his abdomen would rupture if he internalized anything. The hydrophobia was secondary to this concern. When given a glass of water he showed a panic reaction and attempted to keep away. Orientation and memory remained intact. 

The authors go to length to point out that this was not, in fact, a case of rabies (as thought that were in question at this point!). Also, the patient himself was not aware of symptoms of rabies, ruling out ""rabies hysteria"" (a hypochondriacal delusion that one has rabies).

Hydrophobia, then, is a rare manifestation of a rare psychiatric disease in addition to the more frequent and well-known association with rabies.

All songs are designed to just be played with the right hand, however in Pro Mode, songs on Hard and Expert difficulty require you to use both octaves. 

This means that there's no use for you to have a full sized keyboard, as it would leave most of it unused.

Pure speculation: 


If you can use a midi controller instead of the keyboard, you should be able to map certain keys to the five buttons. 
The velocity-sensitivity is probably intended to counter the fact that they're using very 'cheap' keys, which lack the natural resistance of a decent keyboard. My guess would be that you won't notice any difference in game. 
The lack of the expression bar is only a loss if you like using the whammy bar when playing it as a keytar, although you will lose the ability to gain extra Overdrive like you can with the whammy bar on a guitar. For the rest I don't really see a use case for it anyway.

Now, in our case it is not an exception. We don't care it has already been deleted.  We don't want to have to put in a check before the delete and we just want to put in exception handling because it is not really an exception. 

What we would really like to do is not have this exception throw if a delete is attempted and the object is not there.

Is there any way to do this with Grails / Gorm?

The best ideal I have is to do the delete with just a bit of SQL of HSQL rather than use a hibernate / grails API.

cat /dev/urandom | strings --bytes 1 | tr -d '\n\t ' | head --bytes 32


to generate pseudo-random passwords. This doesn't work with /dev/random.

Specifically

cat  /dev/random | strings --bytes 1 produces output
cat  /dev/random | strings --bytes 1 | tr -d '\n\t  ' does not produce output


NB: When using /dev/random you may have to wiggle your mouse or press keys (e.g. ctrl, shift, etc.) to generate entropy.

Why does the last example not work? Does tr have some kind of large internal buffer that /dev/urandom fills quickly but /dev/random doesn't?

P.S. I'm using CentOS 6.5

",Aaron J Lang,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/18799,"Generating random numbers for many security applications requires sufficient entropy — entropy measures how unpredictable the randomness is. A deterministic processor cannot generate entropy, so entropy must come from the outside — either from a hardware component with non-deterministic behavior, or from other factors that are sufficiently hard to reproduce such as the timing of user actions (that's where wiggling the mouse comes in). Once sufficient entropy is available, cryptography can be used to generate a practically unlimited stream of random numbers.

Linux works by accummulating entropy in a pool, then using cryptography to produce acceptable random numbers both through /dev/random and /dev/urandom. The difference is that /dev/random applies an extremely conservative entropy calculation that reduces the estimate of the entropy in the pool for every byte that it generates, whereas /dev/urandom does not concern itself with the amount of entropy in the pool.

If the estimate of entropy in the pool is too low, /dev/random blocks until more entropy can be accumulated. This can severely cripple the rate at which /dev/random can produce output. This is what you're observing here. It has nothing to do with tr; but strings reads output with buffering, so it has to read a full buffer (a few kB) from /dev/random just to produce at least one byte of input.

/dev/urandom is perfectly acceptable for generating a cryptographic key, because entropy does not in fact decrease in any perceptible way. (If you keep your machine running for longer than the universe has existed, you can't neglect these considerations, but otherwise you're good.) There is only one case where /dev/urandom is not good, which is on a freshly installed system that hasn't had time to generate entropy yet, or a freshly booted system that boots from read-only media.

Elimitating strings from your boot chain will probably speed up your process:

&lt;/dev/random LC_ALL=C tr -dc '~-!'


But you can use /dev/urandom here, as long as you take care not to generate passwords on a system that hasn't had time to accummulate sufficient entropy. You can check the level of Linux's entropy pool in /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail (if you use /dev/random, the figure in this file will be conservative, possibly very much so).

His friend, a marketer, stole the idea (which he was noted as doing often, something the protagonist cheerfully grumbled about) and released it, claiming his company had been working on it all the time. As time went on, the tickler was improved to also automatically remind a person to do routine chores, and to even inject drugs to help make them happier. By the end of the story, the engineer, who has refused the tickler, realizes that the ticklers have taken over.

One of the other odd details that stuck in my mind was that the marketing friend drops off a case of lifelike masks for the engineer, prior products of the company, and he and his wife have a brief bout of fun while she's wearing the face of a prominent actress.

4261,5351,question and answer 8495,Advice on an inexpensive but very hardy/tough point-and-shoot camera,"I'm looking for a reasonably cheap point-and-shoot camera that can take a lot of abuse.  Think rain, mud, occasional falls from head height, etc.

To make it easier, I really don't care too much about special features, zoom, or the quality of the photo.  As long as it's reasonably viewable at the end, that's good enough for me.

I'm aware of the Olympus µ cameras, but they still try to pack in the features and that drives up the price.

Any suggestions?

I don't know about recent Pentax models, but (although I love my Pentax DSLR!) Pentax's record with P&amp;S cameras has been lackluster.

4277,5368,question and answer 8527,"What do you call a customer's customer in a specification document, use case, or scenario?","My team and I develop software that our customers will use to interact with their customers.  Additionally, we also eat our own dogfood and use the software ourselves to interact with our customers.

Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to explain use cases and scenarios, as our employees can be operators, our customers can be operators, and our customers' customers can be visitors.

However, our customers can also be visitors interacting with our operator employees, our customers' customers can be visitors interacting with our customer or our employee.

Here is a model where:

A is an employee
B is a customer
C is our customers' customer

X  interacts with  Y
Operator --&gt; Visitor
      A  --&gt;  B
      A  --&gt;  C
      B  --&gt;  C


Because sometimes our customers can play different roles, it's sometimes necessary to refer to the specific role, Operator or Visitor, instead of Employee and Customer.

It's also a mouthful to say ""customer's customer"" all the time.

I was wondering how other development shops handle these semantic details when writing their use cases and scenarios.  


Are there any one-word, generic terms that can apply to any product that involves a third-level actor?
Other than using the specific roles, Operator and Visitor, what words could be used to identify a customer of a customer?  


The word would need to be short enough as to be adopted within an organization.  If longer than a couple syllables, it's shortened form must still differentiate it from the other actors.

",Pacerier,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/102,"No. It would not be a sin, necessarily, but simply an incorrect assumption. It may be a sin to teach this, however, because it is contrary to the teachings of Scripture, and you would be leading your brothers and sisters astray.

Consider what is said in Romans 3:27-28:


  27 Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. 28 For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.


If one has not faith, but only has works, it does not count for their salvation. That isn't to say that works are not important, as you can look at James 2:26:


  26 As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.


If one has faith, works will naturally follow. If one's faith does not produce works, then what is that faith? Our faith should be fruitful and produce works. This is actually analogous to the story of Jesus and the fig tree in Mark 11:12-14:


  12 The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. 13 Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. 14 Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard him say it.


If we are the tree, and we have no faith, it will not produce fruit (works). If we are a tree producing fruit, however, God will bless us and we will feed many (figuratively or literally, depending on the work) with the fruit of our works.

Otherwise the users are going to be very fed up with having to go through a UAC dialog in order to run your application. Even if they aren't using the part of the application that writes to HKLM.

4285,5378,question and answer 8544,Cubic graphs without a perfect matching and a vertex incident to three bridges,"The example shown below (courtesy of David Eppstein) is a common example of a cubic graph  that admits no perfect matching:



Are there other examples of cubic graphs that do not admit a perfect matching and, unlike the above example, do not contain a vertex that lies at the intersection of three bridges (i.e. an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph)?
",Anthony Labarre,https://mathoverflow.net/users/3356,"Substitute your central vertex in your graph with a 3-cycle $abc$ so that the graph stays cubic. Now subdivide each edge in this 3-cycle. So we have new vertices $u$ connected to $a$ and $b$, $v$ connected to $b$ and $c$, $w$ connected to $c$ and $a$. Now add a final vertex $x$ and connect it to $u,v$ and $w$. This graph has exactly three bridges, none of which intersect the other at a vertex, and moreover has no perfect matching!

One result which relates the existence of a perfect matching in a cubic graph and its bridges is the following theorem of Petersen from ""Die theorie der regularen graphen"", Acta Math. 15
(1891), 163-220:


  Theorem: Every cubic graph with at most two bridges contains a perfect matching. 


As well as this strengthening by Errera, ""Du colorage des cartes"", Mathesis 36 (1922), 56-60:


  Theorem: If all the bridges of a connected cubic graph $G$ lie on a single path of $G$, then $G$ has a perfect matching.


So your instinct is true, in the sense that if the graph has no perfect matching, its bridges do not lie on a path. However the example in the beginning of this answer shows that they are not necessarily incident at the same vertex.

",Dan Blows,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/7762,"Ask a simple question, get a simple answer: it’s because that’s how we speak it in English:


  Today is Thursday, May 24th, 2012.


Now convert the month name to a natural number, and there you have your answer. What’s today’s date?  It’s May 24th.  Instead of writing May-24, we simply change the “May” to “5” and write 5-24 or ⁵⁄₂₄.  

That way it follows the natural language order and so requires no mental gymnastics to switch things around when speaking the date aloud.  Similarly “September 11th” gets written ⁹⁄₁₁, etc.   

The full spoken form with the year, “May 24th, 2012”, then becomes the written shorthand “5/24/2012”, or often just “5/24/12”.  “Christmas of 2001” can be, and somewhat annoying often is, written “12/25/1”, while “January 25th, 2012” becomes “1/25/12”. 

This isn’t usually any sort of problem because of universal consensus on how to interpret such things in the United States.  If you write day/month/year in America, you will not be understood.  Although I myself prefer the ISO notation, normal people do not use it in their daily affairs. 

EDIT

I’ve deleted the rest of the material in case it was distracting the downvoters. 
I have no idea what the downvoters are disagreeing with, since they did not condescend to say why.  The standard and accepted answer as to why Americans write the month first is indeed because they say it first in speech.  A trivial Google comes up with this very same answer repeated dozens and dozens of times. 

I suggest that if you do not like this answer, you do me the courtesy to say why you think this one is wrong. Even better, provide your own answer if you think mine is wrong.

Probably the easiest way to do this is to mount the drive as read-only. You can do this by using diskutil from Terminal.

Eject the disk by running diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX (which would be ""disk2"" for me)
Remount disk in read only mode by running diskutil mountDisk readOnly /dev/diskX
Use Finder or Terminal to examine the disk.


Note that if you eject the drive, you'd need to run this sequence again to have it mount as read only. There are other apps that automate mounting disks as read only but the command line is the only real UI for any OS! ;-) #opinion

Now the battery will not charge through the mains adapter. It did charge at first.  However, I have found it does charge through USB connection to my PC.
When it charged previously a light at the connector would be red.  When it was not charging it would be green.  It is red while USB connected. 

Also it tells me now that it is charging, but if I remove the USB connection it stops charging. It has a screen showing battery condition in the form of a graph.  I could see the graph of battery % decreasing gradually.  A few days ago there was a sudden drop as if some App had used a lot of power.  

I decided to remove all Apps and did a factory reset.  This made no difference regarding the failure to charge. I have tried shutting down completely (hold the off button for a while and it asks if I want to power off)  

This made no difference.
Any advice please?

Edit #1: Thanks ce4 for your response. The charger is stated to be 5v and when I check it with a voltmeter, it shows 5.2v. Also I have tried pushing the plug into the tablet to varying amounts and makes no difference. Another point maybe I didn't make clear is that when I connect with USB only, the light does not come on but the device tells me it is charging.

But when I connect the power supply as well, the light comes on red as if indicating charging. But when I remove the USB leaving the power supply connected, the light goes back to green and is not charging from the power supply.

Despite apparently charging on USB, the percentage of battery left charged has not yet increased from 10%. I understand that USB cannot deliver high current. It appears you are right - something wrong with the charger - maybe it is not the correct one for this model - I guess it needs to be able to deliver power at a higher current level?

4302,5399,question and answer 8576,C# + PHP in the same application?,"What im trying to do is a little different, im wondering, if its possible to create sorts of an interface, so that if a particular function is called in php (stand alone), than the arguments will be forwarded to a method in C#, and vice versa. 
",caesay,https://stackoverflow.com/users/184746,"Depends of course on what kind of data you want to exchange, if the applications are on the same server or on two different ones etc.

I did briding between PHP and C# in some of my web based projects. What I did: create an ASP.NET MVC project which exposes a RESTful API. The methods exposed by this API are then called from PHP via HTTP (using CURL). I used JSON as a data exchange format to pass data from PHP to C# and back again. This worked good as the two applications were on different servers.

I could also imagine some kind of socket server. E. g. a background process written in C# is listening on some port, and then you connect to it via PHP´s socket functions. I did something like this to connect PHP and Java. The Java app ran as a demon process on port XXXX and was a wrapper around Apache FOP. I used PHPs socket functions to pass XML and XSLT to the Java demon which then used Apache FOP to transform the data into a pdf and returned that via the socket connection back to PHP which in turn sent the PDF file to the client requesting the page.

There are probably some other approaches, but these were my experiences so far in connecting two different technologies together.

EDIT: as an aside: PHP on a windows webserver using IIS was really not that nice to work with. Sometimes strange errors occured or certain permission related errors that were not easy to resolve. YMMV though.

Then the integral of the divergence over a disc is the integral of the vector field dot the normal vector over a circle, which switches sign periodically in the radius of the function, so the divergence must switch sign arbitrarily often, so it can't be proper.

Moreover because it switches sign with arbitrarily large radius, the set where it is 0 cannot be compact.

4319,5418,question and answer 8603,Twisted pair cable twists and unwanted signals issue,"I am confused about one point I have read the following paragraph from the networking book.
“the twists in the twisted pair cable are used to avoid the unwanted signals. For example one twist, one wire is closer to the noise source and the other is farther; in the next twist the reverse is true. Twisting makes its probable that both wires are equally affected by the unwanted signal. This means that the receiver which calculate the difference between the two receives no unwanted signal.”

Now ok I understood the purpose of twists but I am confused about how receiver will calculate the difference when it will receive the signal?. How unwanted signal will be eliminated ? 
Another thing that I want to make clear is ,  I am beginner please provide such an answer that can be understood.
",Zia ur Rahman,https://serverfault.com/users/44270,"Wikipedia has a good article on twisted pair (excerpt below):


  In balanced pair operation, the two
  wires carry equal and opposite signals
  and the destination detects the
  difference between the two. This is
  known as differential mode
  transmission. Noise sources introduce
  signals into the wires by coupling of
  electric or magnetic fields and tend
  to couple to both wires equally. The
  noise thus produces a common-mode
  signal which is cancelled at the
  receiver when the difference signal is
  taken. This method starts to fail when
  the noise source is close to the
  signal wires; the closer wire will
  couple with the noise more strongly
  and the common-mode rejection of the
  receiver will fail to eliminate it.
  This problem is especially apparent in
  telecommunication cables where pairs
  in the same cable lie next to each
  other for many miles. One pair can
  induce crosstalk in another and it is
  additive along the length of the
  cable. Twisting the pairs counters
  this effect as on each half twist the
  wire nearest to the noise-source is
  exchanged. Providing the interfering
  source remains uniform, or nearly so,
  over the distance of a single twist,
  the induced noise will remain
  common-mode. Differential signaling
  also reduces electromagnetic radiation
  from the cable, along with the
  associated attenuation allowing for
  greater distance between exchanges.

I provided some scenarios which I need to solve but I'm thankful for any hints or links on how to solve just one of them or how to described this scenario (and/or solutions) in proper 'mathematical notaion'

The Problem:
An urn contains 10 balls numbered from 1 to 10, every number occurs excactly once.
Person A picks balls from the urne and distributes the balls randomly among 4 other persons, say persons B, C, D and E (it is not neccessary for every person to get the same amount of balls). 
After the distribution process, person C picks $N$ ball(s) from its own urn, which holds another 10 balls, again numbered from 1 to 10.
What is the probability that person C received one or more balls from person A which have the same number as the ball(s) person C just picked from its own urn?

Some scenarios:
Scenario 1: Person C received one ball with nr.7. What is the probability that person C picks the ball with the same number (7) from its own urn?
Scenario 2: Person C received two balls with nr.7 and nr.8. What is the probability that person C picks the same two balls (7 and 8) from its own urn?
Scenario 3: Person C received two balls with nr.7 and nr.8. What is the probability that person C picks one ball from its own urn which number is either 7 or 8?
Scenario 4: Person C received one ball with nr.7. What is the probability that person C picks two balls of its own urn out of which one is ball nr.7?
Scenario 5: Person C received one ball with nr.7 and person D received three other balls, say balls 4, 5 and 6. What is the probability that person C picks one ball from its own urn which number is either 4, 5, 6 or 7? (Person C and person D are merged, they count as one)
",froua,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/230518,"For the general question, assuming picks are without replacement:


for each numbered ball picked by C from their own urn, the probability C did not get that numbered ball from A is $\displaystyle \frac34$ (i.e. it went to B, D or E), 
so the probability of no matches is $\displaystyle \left(\frac34\right)^N$, 
the probability of at least one match is $\displaystyle 1-\left(\frac34\right)^N$ and 
the probability of $n$ matches is $\displaystyle {N \choose n}\frac{3^{N-n}}{4^N}$. 


For the scenarios the numbered balls received by C from A are determined by the scenario, so:


if C picks one from ten balls, the probability it is number $7$ is $\dfrac{1}{10}$
if C picks two from ten balls, the probability they are numbers $7$  and $8$ is $\dfrac{1}{45}$
if C picks two from ten balls, the probability exactly one is number $7$  or $8$ is $\dfrac{16}{45}$, and the probability at least one is number $7$  or $8$ is $\dfrac{17}{45}$ 
if C picks two from ten balls, the probability one is number $7$ is $\dfrac{1}{5}$ 
if C picks one from ten balls, the probability it is numbers $4$, $5$, $6$ or $7$ is $\dfrac{2}{5}$

Sometimes when I start it up, begin moving forward, or quickly decelerate I can hear what sounds like water (or some other liquid) moving from one place to another (can't quite tell where) under the dash or maybe just behind the firewall.  I took it to the Suzuki service center (almost 2 hour drive from my home), and they told me that the A/C coolant was low.  They refilled it and sent me on my way.  However, I still hear the sloshing sound behind the dash.  Does anyone have any ideas on what this might be?  Thanks.

ADDITIONAL INFO

I've recently noticed that when this ""running water"" sound occurs that it is more prominent when the engine is running faster (e.g. during acceleration).  This leads me to believe maybe this has something to do with the water pump, or some other liquid pump, that is run by the engine and not moving enough liquid to fill the pipe, hence a sloshing / running water sound.
",Jim Fell,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/1211,"My experience (in multiple cars, albeit not your make/model) has been that this sound always means your cooling system is under-filled. If you've emptied your cooling system and refilled it, it can be really hard to get all the air pockets out of the heater core, especially since in many vehicles it's almost as high as the radiator cap and at the opposite end of the system. The best system I know of is to park on a steep grade with the front of the car facing upward, then let the engine run with the radiator cap off. Squeezing the hoses, especially the hoses near the back of the engine compartment that go to the heater core, and varying the throttle can help. You should get bubbles coming up the top of the radiator. Whenever the fluid level drops, add some more coolant, and repeat until you can't get any more bubbling.

By the way, another symptom that might indicate this is your problem is that it's usually associated with poor heater performance (taking a long time to get heat, or only getting warm air, not hot air, out of the heater).

",Willow,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/3494,"EPS, is an acronym for Encapsulated Post Script - it is a package of information (vector and raster elements) used for cross-platform print documents.  Most would considered this a legacy format, well supported for print. In terms of vector information - it is probably the best choice for what you describe, Willow. 

The EPS format can be used for RGB images - but in fact EPS will never be efficient for rgb, as it is designed for post-script print files.

Your vector images will always be printable as EPS, but it's not a particularly efficient file format and if you do include raster images, the transparency is not well accomodated (as you may have to save the alpha channel separately)

4347,5453,question and answer 8654,where to put .sty and .cls file for project,"I want to use my own .sty and .cls file in a project. I know of the following two possibilities of placing them:


in my local tex tree (or the general tex tree, which is worse)
in the same directory as the .tex file


Both of these I find unsatisfactory for the following reasons:

The local tex tree is unsatisfactory since the .sty file is specific for the project, so I want it to be close to the project, so I easily remember where it is etc. Also, I am using dropbox to synchronize the project files between different computers automatically, so the .sty file should be in the dropbox folder.

The 'same directory' is unsatisfactory since the project is in a directory with many subdirectories. The .tex files in all these subdirectories should be able to access the same .sty file.

What I would like to do is: create a subdirectory 'style files' in the project directory, where I put style and class files (there are several for the project), then tell tex somehow where to find them.

How can I do this?

I am using a recent TexLive on  Mac OS X.6

",Daniel,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/9171,"At the top level of the TeX Live distribution there is a texmf.cnf file that you can edit, if you don't want to set environment variables; the usual value for TEXMFHOME is, with an vanilla TeX Live

TEXMFHOME = ~/texmf

TEXMFHOME = ~/Library/texmf


This kpathsea variable can be set to whatever you prefer:

TEXMFHOME = {~/Library/texmf,/Volumes/Dropbox/texmf}


would make TeX programs search also the texmf folder (which should be organized as a TeX tree) in the disk called Dropbox. You should know the precise path to give. Assuming this, you can put your classes and packages inside 

/Volumes/Dropbox/texmf/tex/latex/myproject


(choose a better name) and all users that modify accordingly the texmf.cnf file on their machines will be able to access the tree.

Launching TeX programs as, say,

TEXMFHOME=:/Volumes/Dropbox/texmf// pdflatex filename


would be equivalent (notice the initial colon that means ""append"" the new tree after the value stated in texmf.cnf and the trailing // to mean ""search recursively). Such a setting of TEXMFHOME can be of course stated in the overall environment. The texmf.cnf way is safer, as it doesn't depend on shell setup; the extra tree will be ignored if not found on the system.

4351,5458,question and answer 8665,Is it possible to build a CPU from content-addressable memory?,"Every modern programming language use objects and not C/C++ style struct/class.
In C/C++ every data member has a size, so addressing a struct member is basically a memory address + offset. But script languages just like JavaScript and many others use an object ID that contains key/value pairs. These key/value pairs can be also an object ID.

So nowadays hardware memory is addressed with memory address + offset or memory address to a lookup table where key/value are stored.

A memory address can contains data or ASM code that is executable by a CPU.

So is it possible to build a hardware that only contains content-addressable memory (CAM)?

I can imagine the following:

Data:

id: 23
  -key: 123, value: 7
  -key: 456, value: 8
  -key: 789, value: 0


This is a scheme of a content addressable memory block. This block can be write with a SetValue(id, key, value) opcode and can read with a GetValue(id, key)

My idea is that if I specify a key/value pair for executable memory block I got a CPU.

If a memory block contains special key value pairs it will act like an opcode. For example if contains a key that is &lt; 100 than it is an opcode

id: 45
  -key: 12, value: 7  // key 12 opcode for add two data
  -key: 10, value: 8  // key 10 is arg1, value is a data
  -key: 11, value: 9  // key 11 is arg2, value is a data


In this architecture every memory block an object and every memory block a minimal CPU at the same time. Do you think is it possible to build such a hardware?

For practical purposes, you would have a CAM peripheral, like a graphics accelerator.

Intuitively I would like to give them less information, but I also don't want to appear guarded and defensive as a person, either.
",Irwin,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/5944,"If you don't want to disclose that, you can simply say: ""I'd rather not discuss this"", and you can look straight into your interviewer eyes with that. I've seen candidates do that; it may have looked harsh, but there's no obligation on the candidate's side to tell anything beyond the contents of the job talk.

You can also try to convert this into a joke like ""Enough to earn me a free roundtrip this year"". An American faculty should take that as a hint that you don't want to talk about it. An international faculty may need a more straight answer like the one I gave above. (I am talking about the US here as the largest academic market; in UK, as far as I understand, you won't have more than 30 minutes face time with the faculty of the hiring institution, and they probably have more important things to ask than the # of interviews you have.)

Having said that, you need to weight in the benefits of telling vs. not. For one thing, you may not have all the invitations out yet on your first fly-out, so you really don't know yet what other interviews you might have. On the other hand, by the time you reach your sixth destination (if you are lucky to get that many), the first place may already have told you, ""Sorry, we made the offer to somebody else"". So nominally you may have interviewed there, but really you won't get an offer from them.

As a bottom line, you need to do what others in your discipline do. You don't want to look like a fool in the environment where everybody keep their secrets by telling left and right about your choosing between Harvard and Stanford (and thus losing a chance to get a far more realistic offer from Alabama); and you don't want to look like a fool hinting at many undisclosed interviews when your adviser had told them that this is the only interview you have when they called him/her, or your other interviews were posted on a job market rumor website.

Of course there is no order preserving function, so writing both sets with their natural order will promise you that there is no reasonable pattern. Instead write the natural numbers, and then try to write the integers:

$$\begin{array}
&amp; 1 &amp; 2&amp;  3&amp;  4&amp;  5&amp; 6&amp;  7&amp; 8&amp;\ldots\\
  0 &amp; 1&amp; -1&amp; 2&amp; -2&amp;  3&amp; -3&amp; 4&amp;\ldots

This gives rise to a bijection from $\Bbb N$ onto $\Bbb Z$. Now just find its inverse.

4401,5515,question and answer 8749,Radio Waves reach in function of frequency,"What is the relationship between the reach of a RF signal and its frequency?

What I mean is: If power is kept constant, should I use high or low frequency waves to get a better reach? Why?
",Rafael Dazcal,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/11101,"In free space, it doesn't matter.  The power per incident area of a propagating wave is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the transmitter.  This is true regardless of frequency.

Certain frequencies are reflected, refracted, absorbed, and scattered differently by different materials.  There is no single monotonic relationship until you get to really high energies, like gamma rays and beyond.  At these really high energies (high frequencies), the waves basically just blast thru any material in their way, with higher energies passing thru material with less attenutation.  Up to below Xray frequencies, there is no single answer, and it depends on the material between the transmitter and receiver.

Diffraction effects can make low fequencies (long wavelengths) appear to bend around objects, but this actually occurs at all wavelengths.  The ""near"" layer where diffraction effects occur scales with wavelength, so it appears to us at a fixed human scale that long wavelengths go ""around"" objects where short wavelengths don't, but that is due to our perception scale.  On the scale of the earth, commercial AM radio frequencies around 1 MHz are low enough to diffract around the curvature of the earth to some extent making over the horizon AM reception possible.  Commercial FM radio, being 100x shorter wavelength, exhibits this effect much less for the same size earth, so FM radio appears to us to be mostly occluded by the horizon.

But it doesn't. Your delegate is just a variable that when invoked calls something. If you have a string variable, it could contain anything. Your class isn't somehow breaking encapsulation if another class sets your string variable to ""foobar"". Likewise, your class' encapsulation is not broken if your delegate is set to ""hide this UI widget when triggered"".

Separately, they both works alone, but together, firstly ajax function works, second validation works. it is not right.. How can I combine those in one? Firstly to validate form, then get ajax response.

Edit:

Here is form:

 &lt;form action=""#"" method=""post"" id=""quickMessageForm""&gt;
            &lt;div class=""form_info cmsms_input""&gt;
                &lt;label&gt;Email&lt;span class=""color_3""&gt; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
                @Html.TextBoxFor(model =&gt; model.Email, new { name = ""email"", id = ""email"", tabidex = 1, @class = ""validate[required,custom[email]]"" })
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=""form_info cmsms_textarea""&gt;
                &lt;label&gt;Message&lt;span class=""color_3""&gt; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
                @Html.TextAreaFor(model =&gt; model.Message, new { id = ""messageText"", name = ""messageText"", tabindex = 2, @class = ""validate[required,minSize[10]]"" })
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=""loading""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;input type=""submit"" name=""messageSendButton"" id=""messageSendButton"" value=""Send"" class=""button_small"" tabindex=""3"" /&gt;

4432,5560,question and answer 8831,"What is the difference between unicast, anycast, broadcast and multicast traffic?","I have never had the privilege of working in an environment that required complicated routing or if it did require it, it was handled upstream of me. I've always used very simple static routing configurations and never needed to do any multipath routing -- hence my general confusion regarding this subject. I would like to understand multicasting and anycasting better. 


What is the difference between unicast, anycast, broadcast and multicast traffic?
What situations are they generally used in and why (e.g., what applications use which method)?
How do you calculate how much broadcast traffic is too much for a given network segment or broadcast domain?
What are the security implications of allowing broadcast and multicast traffic?

",kce,https://serverfault.com/users/62491,"Here's some basic info:

Unicast: Unicast traffic is traffic that is meant for a single host. All other hosts will ignore unicast traffic not meant for themselves. In a switched environment, unicast traffic is generally not ""heard"" by any hosts other than the host that the traffic is intended for. In an environment that uses hubs (shudder) all hosts will ""hear"" unicast traffic meant for every other host, but they'll ignore all traffic not intended for themselves.

Broadcast: Broadcast traffic is traffic that is sent with the intent of being ""heard"" by all hosts on a particular network segment. Examples of broadcast traffic would be an ARP request, which is a broadcast at the physical layer (MAC address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) or a NetBIOS name query, which is a broadcast at the network layer (whatever happens to be the broadcast address for that particular network, such as 64.28.42.63 for the network 64.28.42.0/26).

Multicast: Multicast traffic is traffic that is sent with the intent of being ""heard"" by a particular group of hosts on a network segment. Some multicast traffic can be considered broadcast traffic, such as traffic to the multicast address 224.0.0.1, which is multicast traffic meant for all hosts on the same network segment. Another example of multicast traffic would be traffic sent to the multicast address 224.0.0.9 which is what RIP routers use to send routing information to other RIP routers on the same network segment.

I'll leave Anycast to someone else as I really don't know that much about it.

Wouldn't this:

",Dynamic,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/34364,"Comments are definitely documentation. For most projects, comments are (unfortunately) the primary (if not only) form of project documentation. For this reason, it's very important to get it right. You need to make sure that this documentation stays accurate despite code changes. This is a common problem with comments. Developers often ""tune"" them out when they're working in familiar code, so they forget to update comments to reflect code. This can create out-of-date, and misleading comments.

A lot of people suggest making the code self-documenting. This means that instead of comments, you restructure your code to remove the need for them. This can get rid of most of the ""what"" and ""how"" comments, but doesn't really help with the ""why"" comments. While this might work effectively to get rid of most comments, there are still plenty of times where writing a comment is the simplest and most efficient way to document a piece of code.

I thought “sign the flourish” an idiom, but I don’t find the phrase in dictionaries I use to consult, or on Google.”  

I wondered if it’s similar with Japanese idiom, “一花咲かせる－hitohana sakaseru” meaning to bloom the last blossoms at the ending, at the last stage of one's career, or before retiring, like a baseball player who passed his peak hitting a streak of homeruns before retiring, but then, the word, “sign” seems to be incongruent.

4459,5591,question and answer 8877,Why do I get the wrong result from this program to compute gross pay?,"This is actually a homework. Here is the question.


  Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay. Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use raw_input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input - assume the user types numbers properly.


I've tried this, but it doesn't work correctly.

hrs = raw_input(""Enter Hours:"")
h = float(hrs)
rate_hour = raw_input(""Enter rate:"")
r = float(rate_hour)
if h &lt;= 40:
    r = 1
else :
    r = 1.5
print h * r 

",coder123,https://stackoverflow.com/users/4776843,"There are a few problems with the way you've approached this.


The question specifies that the rate of pay only increases after 40 hours are worked, and so if 45 hours are worked, only 5 of those hours earn the overtime rate.

Look at the way you have written your if statement, and you should be able to see an incongruence between your code and the question. In particular, you'll need to look at the else: section.
When calculating pay using the standard or overtime rate, remember that the new rate will be a function of the old one. You should be able to see in your code that setting r = 1 or r = 1.5 will cause a problem. Assuming 10 hours have been worked, your code will produce 10 * 1 instead of 10 * rate_hour


To help you:


To modify a variable number such that it is doubled, variable = variable * 2
Calculating pay when more than 40 hours are worked will require 2 separate calculations, so you may want to create a variable pay under if: and else:, and then print that.

Is each application pool equivalent to a .Net AppDomain?
Or it is a equivalent to a .Net process?
How is Application pool related to IIS w3wp.exe? 

",Amitabh,https://stackoverflow.com/users/248827,"
  1 . Is each application pool equivalent to a .Net AppDomain?


No, an application pool may have several AppDomains. Each AppDomain represents a single running ASP.NET Application.  Many ASP.NET Applications may belong to a single Application Pool.


  2 . Or it is a equivalent to a .Net process?


Not quite.  See below.


  3 . How is Application pool related to IIS w3wp.exe?


An application pool represents a limited number of worker processes that may host a potentially larger number of applications.  This is similar to how a SQL Connection Pool shares a limited number of connections among an arbitrary number of requests.

By default, an Application Pool gets one Worker Process (w3wp.exe), and it's usually best to leave this setting alone unless you know what you're doing.  Still, an Application Pool can be configured to use any number of processes.

The Worker Process is actually the resource that's being pooled here, not the AppDomain.  There will always be the same number of AppDomains as there are ASP.NET Applications (unless one is in the middle of shutting down, or an application creates its own AppDomains), but the number of Worker Processes is independent; an Application Pool gives you a specific number of Worker Processes to handle requests for a specific number of AppDomains.

A setting of 1 (the default) for the number of worker processes in an App Pool means that all Applications/AppDomains in the pool share the same worker process.

For example, Internet Explorer requires eot, Safari requires ttf. I think only Chrome uses woff2. Depending on which mobile browser you use you need a different font format. I believe Safari on IOS even uses svg!

I think what you did is, you opened the CSS file Google Fonts gave you and simply copied the content. The problem is, this CSS depends on the User Agent. It has different content with the correct font format for the Browser which requested.

You could use a tool like http://localfont.com to generate the correct CSS with all font formats. They have different formats for downloading fonts as well only generating CSS for inline use.

        QtGui.QMainWindow.__init__(self)
        self.scene = Scene(0, 0, 300, 300, self)
        self.view = QtGui.QGraphicsView()
        self.setCentralWidget(self.view)
        self.view.setScene(self.scene)
        self.scene.addItem(Square(0,0,50,50))

    def mousePressEvent(self, e):
        self.currentItem = self.itemAt(e.pos())
        print (self.currentItem)
        QtGui.QGraphicsScene.mousePressEvent(self, e)

class Square(QtGui.QGraphicsRectItem):
    def __init__(self, *args):
        QtGui.QGraphicsRectItem.__init__(self, *args)
        self.setFlag(QtGui.QGraphicsItem.ItemIsMovable, True)

    win = MainWindowUi()
    win.show()

When you click the mouse in the scene you should see a print statement telling you that you clicked either on the square or on nothing (ie. None). This works if you just start the program and click on the square.

Now drag the square away from the upper left corner and click on it again. This time itemAt() return None even when you click on the square.

4514,5658,question and answer 8972,How to fix a Macbook Pro trackpad where the mouse pointer is randomly moving?,"The trackpad on my Macbook Pro just started acting oddly. It's randomly clicking (which might cause me to switch programs), right-clicking and even once my screen even showed the swiping animation as if I was trying to switch to a different desktop.    

Part of me fears that this is some sort of joke hacking attempt (I know of a USB device you plug into someones computer and it randomly moves their mouse and types on their keyboard), but there is nothing plugged into my machine and I just turned off the Wi-Fi and watched as this web page tried to close, the mouse right clicked twice, highlighted a word and clicked ""Paste and Match Style"" in the Chrome right-click menu.
Also as I've been typing (with my Wi-Fi turned off) the mouse has randomly been clicking inside this question and changing where I am typing.  

I just plugged in a USB mouse which seems to work fine but the trackpad is now nearly useless. I can't even move the mouse cursor more than a few centimeters with it.

Is this a common issue?
EDIT
I think it is dying actually. I can now click but not move at all with the trackpad, while a regular mouse works fine.
EDIT 2
And now it seems to be working again. I turned on the option for ""Ignore Trackpad when Mouse is plugged in"" under Universal Access. I cleaned the trackpad with rubbing alcohol, I whined and complained for a few minutes to my dog, turned off the ""Ignore Trackpad"" setting, unplugged the USB mouse, and the Trackpad appears to be working mostly normally.
If I run my finger across it at the top or bottom portion of the mouse, it works, but there is a line horizontally across it (almost exactly where a physical trackpad button would end on the old trackpads) that is ""dead"".  The mouse stops moving, or moves sluggishly when hitting that spot and that ""spot"" goes across the whole trackpad.

4521,5668,question and answer 8988,why ions and electrons are at different temperatures in plasma?,"In plasma, collision rate among ions or electrons is much larger than the collision rate between ions and electrons. why is that so?
",seeking_infinity,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/57676,"There are lots of different types of plasmas.

In a thermal plasma the electrons and ions will have the same temperature.

In a non-thermal plasma the discharge is driven by some external power supply e.g. capacitatively coupled RF, inductively coupled, pulsed DC E field etc. 

In a non-thermal plasma the electrons generally have a higher temperature than the ions because the energy from the RF or E field couples with the electrons more efficiently. The electrons transfer energy to the gas to sustain the plasma. 

Strictly speaking non-thermal plasmas are not at equilibrium and we cannot necessarily define a temperature, but temperature is generally a useful concept to use.

Collision rates are generally lower for electrons than ions, but not always (e.g. very low energy electrons and SF6 has huge collision rate). 

The reason for the temperature difference is due partly to the driving energy being mostly coupled to the electrons and the partly because the energy is not rapidly transfered by collisions to the neutral gas and ions.

4535,5684,question and answer 9012,"""going to"" vs ""will""","I know several questions were asked about the difference between ""going to"" and ""will"".
Based on several answers (see, for instance, here, here and here), I understood that ""will"" is more spontaneous and ""going to"" is used with more planned actions.

So, it seems that everything is pretty fine. However, in this question, Kosmonaut has an answer in which he states:
""Let's say that tomorrow you will walk your dog from 7 - 8 AM"".

On the one hand, you probably planned to walk your dog long before and thus I should use ""Let's say that tomorrow you're going to walk your dog from 7 - 8 am"". 

On the other hand, since I'm saying ""let's say..."", I'm deciding right now (thus, unplanned) that you will walk your dog. So, even though in this hypothetical situation you made a plan, I'm in a more spontaneous mood deciding right now that that's what you will do tomorrow, and, thus, I should use ""will"".

Which one (if any) of the above explanations is right?
",Manoel Galdino,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/21109,"In most contexts, I am going to [verb] and I will [verb] are interchangeable. Sometimes the former may place more emphasis on the fact of your current intention/expectation, where the latter emphasises the future action.

There are some contexts where the difference is clear, and this may have some bearing on why OP thinks there's a planned/spontaneous distinction (usually there isn't). Say you're round a friend's house watching a football match on TV, and at half-time the beer runs out...


  You: ""I'll nip down the shop and get some more beer.""
  
  Friend: ""It's raining - I'll find my umbrella for you.""


If you reply ""Don't bother - I'm going to use my car"", the implication is you had already decided you were going to use the car before you first said you'd get the beer. But if you say ""Don't bother - I will use my car"", this implies you just made that decision in response to what your friend said.

@Peter Shor mentions another context (""It's going to/It will bite!"") where native speakers often make a distinction. In that case, going to usually signifies immediate danger (it's just about to bite), but will can just mean it's bitten others before, and will/may bite you soon if you're not careful (effectively, the same as ""Careful! It bites!"" where present tense indicates ""habitual"" action).



Kosmonaut's ""Let's say that tomorrow you will walk your dog"" isn't really relevant to the current issue. It could just as well have been ""...tomorrow you are going to walk..."" or even just ""...tomorrow you walk..."". They all mean the same, and in that context there's no real reason to prefer one over another.

I can create a combined plot comparing the various subsets. E.g.

Show[{pairwisecol[data1, Red], 
      pairwisecol[data2, Blue], 
      pairwisecol[data3, Green],  
      pairwisecol[data4, Purple], 
      pairwisecol[data5, Orange]}]




This curently has the major drawbacks that each subset has to be defined and have a colour explicitly assigned to it. Also, Show in this instance overlays all of the DataTicks etc, rather than just the elements from the first plot (as is normally the case with Show[{Plot1,Plot2}]).

What I'm looking for is a way to use the whole (partitioned) dataset datac to generate such a plot/diagram. i.e. something like,

Show[pairwisecol[#, Red] &amp; /@ datac]


but, with Red being replaced by a series of colours to represent each subset (like in the plot shown).

...Alternatively, starting with a 2-level list e.g.

datap = RandomReal[1, {60, 3}];


and a definition of sublist partitions,

parts = {7, 13, 19, 16, 5};


or

partspos = {[[1;;7]], [[8;;20]], [[21;;39]], [[40;;55]], [[56;;60]]};


then defining a function something like:

pairwiseP[data_, partlist_] := ...


that would partition datap into appropriate sublists, create a series of PairwiseScatterPlot's (each with a different plot colour) and then combine them using Show. 

Note that this example has n = 3 independent variables. I am looking for a method that works for 1 &lt; n &lt; ~20.

Can anyone suggest how to do this?

I won't get into the nuance of what that certificate is all about. I'd address the question in the title -do you say certificate 'about' or 'of'.

Though both convey the same meaning, in my opinion, in most of the cases, when you say 'certificate about...' it takes a phrase. I mean to say that there could be some explanation of what that certificate is all about, and not just one word.

For instance a doctor's certificate about the applicant's fitness for the job 

On the other hand, 'certificate of' is short and terse. It directly says what is that certificate with no explanation. 

Say - a certificate of registration/membership/excellence/participation...and so on

(so far so good).

now I want to know for a given 2 objects(A,B), a start time and a speed, how can I work out the when and where to go. I can work out where A and B is given a time.
so i just need.

1: direction to travel in from A to B(remember B is moving(not in a straight line))
2: Time to get to b in a straight line. 

travel must be in a straight line with the shortest possible distance.

as an extension to this question, how will i know if its better to wait, EG is it faster to stay on object A and wait for a hour when the objects may be closer, than to set off from A to B at the start.

",user20733,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/20733,"If your bodies are subject to complex orbits it may well be difficult or impossible to solve using a closed-form expression (solve an equation to get the desired results.

One approach would be to perform a mathematical simulation over time to arrive at a solution.

In your case, a body leaving A at a time t0 travelling in a straight line with velocity v will be somewhere on the circumference of a circle or (sphere in 3D) with radius vt (t=time since leaving). The centre of the circle will be the position of A at the time of launch (Apos(t0)). You can imagine this circle like a ripple on a pond getting bigger over time)

Assuming you can calculate the position of B at time t+t0 (Bpos(t+t0)), you can create a simulation with a loop to find out the earliest time that the growing circle intersects B's path

searching=true
t=0
while(searching){
    if (distance between Apos(t0) and Bpos(t0+t)) &lt; v*t then{
        searching=false //found a solution
        target_position=Bpos(t0+t) // can be used to find direction to head in
        time_to_reach_B=t
    }
    else
        t+=delta_t //a small time step (smaller = more accuracy)
}


You will of course have to add code to prevent an infinite loop in the case that there is no solution (or no solution to be found in reasonable time).

Depending on the complexity or B's motion and the value of delta_t, this algorithm is not guaranteed to find the ideal solution in every case, but should work well for the vast majority of cases.

",Sandy,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/35971,"Given that 20 meters of head only equates to 1.96 Bar (1m elevation = 0.0980413943 Bar), no pipe alone will do this - you'll need a pump, or you'll need to accept less than 2 Bar as all the pressure you have available.

Then you need to determine the flow rate you wish to operate at for sizing the pipe - you'll get 1.96 bar with any size pipe and no flow (static head) but as you actually use water the pressure will drop (dynamic head) in relation to to pipe size and rate of flow. That is essentially friction in the pipe resisting flow and reducing the effective head. Calculators are available and the formulas for that are adequately complex that using one is suggested. Aside from size of pipe and flow rate, pipe material enters into it as some types are smoother inside and thus have less friction for a given size of pipe than other types.

For example, if you were sizing for 12 l/min, 25mm plastic pipe would have about 2.7 m dynamic head, leaving you with 17.3m head pressure (delivery pressure = 1.7 Bar), and 50 mm pipe would only lose 0.0925m at that flow rate (delivery pressure = 1.9 Bar). 

Bump the flow up to 120 l/min and the 50 mm pipe costs 6.55m head (delivery pressure = 1.3 Bar) - but the 25mm pipe cannot provide that flow rate at all with 20m head - it tops out at about 35 l/min with no pressure at the house end (20 m static head - 20m dynamic head; delivery pressure = 0 Bar)

4609,5770,question and answer 9146,Seperation of drawing and logic in games,"I'm a developer that's just now starting to mess around with game development. I'm a .Net guy, so I've messed with XNA and am now playing around with Cocos2d for the iPhone. My question really is more general though. 

Let's say I'm building a simple Pong game. I'd have a Ball class and a Paddle class. Coming from the business world development, my first instinct is to not have any drawing or input handling code in either of these classes.

//pseudo code
class Ball
{
   Vector2D position;
   Vector2D velocity;
   Color color;
   void Move(){}
}


Nothing in the ball class handles input, or deals with drawing. I'd then have another class, my Game class, or my Scene.m (in Cocos2D) which would new up the Ball, and during the game loop, it would manipulate the ball as needed.

The thing is though, in many tutorials for both XNA and Cocos2D, I see a pattern like this:

//pseudo code
class Ball : SomeUpdatableComponent
{
   Vector2D position;
   Vector2D velocity;
   Color color;
   void Update(){}
   void Draw(){}
   void HandleInput(){}
}


My question is, is this right? Is this the pattern that people use in game development? It somehow goes against everything I'm used to, to have my Ball class do everything. Furthermore, in this second example, where my Ball knows how to move around, how would I handle collision detection with the Paddle? Would the Ball need to have knowledge of the Paddle? In my first example, the Game class would have references to both the Ball and the Paddle, and then ship both of those off to some CollisionDetection manager or something, but how do I deal with the complexity of various components, if each individual component does everything themselves? (I hope I'm making sense.....)
",BFree,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/4911,"I recently made a simple Space Invadors game using an 'entity system'.  It's a pattern that separates attributes and behaviours extremely well.  It took me a few iterations to fully understand it, but once you get a few components designed it becomes extremely simples to compose new objects using your existing components.

You should read this:

http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-1/

It's updated frequently by an extremely knowledgable guy.  It's also the only entity system discussion with concrete code examples.

My iterations went as follows:

The first iteration had an ""EntitySystem"" object which was as Adam describes; however my components still had methods- my 'renderable' component had a paint() method, and my position component had a move() method and etc.  When I began to flesh out the entities I realized that I needed to start passing message between components and ordering the execution of components updates....way too messy.

So, I went back and re-read T-machines blog.  There is a lot of information in the comment threads- and in them he really emphasizes that components do not have behaviours- behaviours are provided by the entity systems.  In this way you do not need to pass messages between components and order component updates because the ordering is determined by the global order of system execution.  Ok.  Maybe that's too abstract.

Anyway for iteration #2 this is what I gleaned from the blog:

EntityManager - acts as the component ""database"", which can be queried for entities which contain certain types of components.  This can even be backed by an in-memory database for speedy access...see t-machine part 5 for more info.

EntitySystem - Each system is essentially just a method which operates on a set of entites.  Each system will use component x,y and z of an entity to get it's work done.  So you would query the manager for entities with components x,y and z then pass that result to the system.

Entity - just an id, like a long.  The entity is what groups a set of components instances together into an 'entity'.

Component - a set of fields....no behaviours!  when you start adding behaviours it starts to get messy...even in a simple Space Invadors game.

Edit: by the way, 'dt' is the delta time since the last main loop invocation

So my main Invadors loop is this:

Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithGuns = manager.getEntitiesWith(Gun.class);
Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithDamagable =
manager.getEntitiesWith(BulletDamagable.class);
Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithInvadorDamagable = manager.getEntitiesWith(InvadorDamagable.class);

keyboardShipControllerSystem.update(entitiesWithGuns, dt);
touchInputSystem.update(entitiesWithGuns, dt);
Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithInvadorMovement = manager.getEntitiesWith(InvadorMovement.class);
invadorMovementSystem.update(entitiesWithInvadorMovement);

Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithVelocity = manager.getEntitiesWith(Velocity.class);
movementSystem.move(entitiesWithVelocity, dt);
gunSystem.update(entitiesWithGuns, System.currentTimeMillis());
Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithPositionAndForm = manager.getEntitiesWith(Position.class, Form.class);
collisionSystem.checkCollisions(entitiesWithPositionAndForm);


It looks a little weird at first, but it's incredibly flexible.  It's also very easy to optimize; for different component types you can have different backing datastores to make retrieval faster.  For the 'form' class you can have it backed with a quadtree to speed access for collision detection.

I'm like you; I'm a seasoned developer but had no experience writing games.  I spent a some time researching gave dev patterns, and this one caught my eye.  It is in no way the only way to do things, but I've found it very intuitive and robust.  I believe the pattern was officially discussed in book 6 of the series ""Game Programming Gems"" - http://www.amazon.com/Game-Programming-Gems/dp/1584500492.  I haven't read any of the books myself but I hear they are the de-facto reference for game programming.

  Blank lines in align environment  




When I put a blank line between a line of text and the align environment, it will add two blank lines instead. It seems that the align environment automatically adds a set of blank lines. I don't want two sets of blank lines, but this makes my code very hard to read. Compare (the 'correct way')

\begin{align*}
L\frac{di}{dt} + Ri = EU(t) \\
i(0) = 0
\end{align*}
In Heaviside's operator notation, this is 
\begin{align*}
pLi + Ri &amp;= EU(t)\\
i &amp;= \frac{E}{pL + R}U(t)
\end{align*}


and 

\begin{align*}
L\frac{di}{dt} + Ri = EU(t) \\
i(0) = 0
\end{align*}

In Heaviside's operator notation, this is 

\begin{align*}
pLi + Ri &amp;= EU(t)\\
i &amp;= \frac{E}{pL + R}U(t)
\end{align*}


This may seem trivial but in a large document it's really hard to read the first example and relatively easy to read the second. 

Is there a way to change this, e.g. with a \renewcommand?

By the way, is there an easier way of putting code on this site besides hitting space bar 4 times for each line? I tried HTML tags but they don't work.

4630,5792,question and answer 9177,Finding out how host names are resolved,"I'm working on a network analysis tool (academic research), and I would like to find out what DNS is used on the machine the software is running on. I'm not a network admin, and I'm wondering: what's the easiest way to find that out; across platforms (that is, on each Linux, Mac and Windows), and preferably using something that's accessible in Python?

Usually, systems seem to conveniently hide this stuff from the user -- I can set a fixed DNS, or I can use my router's settings via DHCP, or ... I'm sure there are other systems too (LDAP?). So just looking at resolv.conf may not always lead to the right answer -- or does it?

Many thanks!
",sebastian_k,https://serverfault.com/users/91350,"If you're on Linux, resolv.conf does cut it. Just for DNS, though. The other methods of resolving hosts are not associated with DNS. Check out your system's nsswitch.conf for more information.

FYI, auto-DHCP config works by automatically editing resolv.conf.

As for OS X, I don't use em enough. I believe that sort of thing gets stored in some binary databases which replace the local files but really don't know.

For Windows, I believe a netsh interface ip show dns does what you want. Windows also uses name resolution mechanisms other than DNS: network broadcasts are especially annoying.

For n players choose n commonities, add in the Bull and Bear, shuffle and deal out the cards. The rules state that everyone gets 9 cards. Doh! With the Bull and the Bear added in that doesn't work.

The way we reconcile this is two people have 10 cards which gives them a significant advantage, e.g. they can simply hold a single card of a commodity to effectively eliminate whoever ends up going for that commodity.

Are there better solutions to this? 
",John Robertson,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/800,"In the group where I've often played Pit, we discarded the Bull and Bear cards before shuffling. It makes the game simpler and better, in my humble opinion.

That being said, we can still debate which is the best solution if you do want to keep those cards. MrHen's solution may well win that honour. A different option would be to discard two cards at random every time you deal. The advantage is that the playing field is level; however, there are up to two commodities that cannot be completed. But in this version, all players are equally likely to be affected.

I could see a few variants of this variant:


Make the discarded cards secret. At the end of every round people are going to be frustrated that their chosen commodity was unwinnable.
Make the discarded cards public. Now all commodities of the discarded type are effectively Bear cards.
Start a timer for (say) 30 seconds when the round starts. At the end, if no one has won yet, play is interrupted and one of the discarded cards is made public. Players try not to give away that they were close to finalizing a ""doomed"" commodity. Play continues for another 30 seconds and is interrupted again to make the last card public. Chaos ensues.

4651,5822,question and answer 9226,sleeping SPID blocking other transactions,"I'm really having trouble tracking down some blocking we are experiencing.

The root blocking SPID's status is 'sleeping', the cmd is 'AWAITING COMMAND', and the sqltext is 'SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED'.

When I view the Top Transactions by Blocked Transactions Count report, the Blocking SQL Statement is '--'.

I've performed a trace on the SQL and when the blocking happens tracing the root blocking SPID but it hasn't really led me anywhere.  The last trace statement is the same as the sqltext above 'SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED'.

I've checked all the related SPROCs I can find to make sure they have TRY/CATCH BEGIN TRAN/COMMIT TRAN/ROLLBACK TRAN statements (we use SPROCs for everything so there are no standalone statements being ran).  This issue just started happening over the last 24 hours and no one is claiming to have made any changes to the system.

Solution.  One of our seldomly used SPROCs had an error with an insert (number of columns didn't match), but we are still confused on what exactly was happening.

When looking at all the trace information, the EXEC statement for this SPROC was listed at times, but NEVER just before the BLOCK happened on the blockking SPID.  It seemed that when it starting blocking, the trace didn't record the execution of it (or any of the statements within it either).  However there are other times were the trace did record it's execution and no blocking occurred.

The SPROC error report came from a user, and I was able to find multiple EXEC statements in traces and run them in SSMS.  No time when I ran them did we have any blocking occur or did they hang.  They ran as expected (the catch block fired and rolled back the transaction after the error).  After resolving the fixing the SPROC, we have not seen the issue again.

Noise being the same at such low ISO setting, what you are left is the question of resolution which depends on how big you intend to print. If large, the D800 is certainly worth the money. If not, then getting the D600 will probably afford you a better lens which is even more important when it comes to sharpness.

The one thing you did not mention which is important for landscape is dynamic-range. The D600 has a slightly wider DR than the D800. So, if the resolution is not an issue for the print sizes you make, I would strongly consider the D600 instead.

4670,5844,question and answer 9261,Isn’t the FAQ label obsolete by now?,"Don’t get me wrong in the beginning of reading this. I really mean the label and not the content of FAQ. The content is very useful if its’ made the right way (as here on ux.se), but there are plenty of examples where it isn’t. The real question concerns the label which is a convention I’d like to challenge.

History

In 1647 Matthew Hopkins wrote The Discovery of Witches which were introduced as ""Certain Queries answered"" and had the form of a list of Question and Answer, even if the topic is inappropriate by today’s standards. The label FAQ origins from the early 1980s mailing lists where NASA hoped to get new users read the old mail conversations, which were not the case. Instead the same questions were answered again and again and the need for FAQ was born. The acronym FAQ was invented by Eugene Miya and FAQ were later used in mail on a weekly basis at first and later on as a daily mail.


  Today FAQ is more frequently used to refer to the list, and a text consisting of questions and their answers is often called an FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually frequently asked, if they are asked at all.[1]


Problem

Acronyms are generally bad, since it excludes those who do not know the meaning. They either have to search for the acronym, if they are interested, or just ignore it. If a label is ignored, there is not much use of it and an entire section of valid content is lost by bad labeling. However, it is a very strong web convention which might lead to confusion over time for experienced users.
Also the original meaning have changed (see quote), which also implies that the label would be wrong.

Question

Isn’t the FAQ label obsolete by now? and if so How do we relabel it to suit both experienced and new users?



Edit: I’d really like to know why we can or cannot change the label FAQ. Current answer does not meet that criterion.

[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAQ
",Benny Skogberg,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/4679,"Obsolete, no.

It is still and will likely remain the most intuitive label for sections of ""frequently asked questions"" or similar secondary information.



When not to use FAQ

I do believe there are plenty of times where ""FAQ"" isn't the right label. I think it boils down to the question of if the term you are considering as an alternative is REALLY more intuitive than FAQ. Does it describe the section better? Would the user be able to navigate there intuitively?

4702,5886,question and answer 9322,Voltage ratings of capacitors: ceramic vs electrolytic,"Now I know when it comes to electrolytic capacitors it's usually good practice to use a voltage rating 1.5x - 2.5x the maximum rating you ever expect the capacitor to be exposed to, as the lifetime can be significantly reduced by running it near its limits.

But does the same protocol apply to ceramic capacitors? For example, assume a 25V ceramic capacitor - will running it at 24V reduce its lifespan significantly?

I'm currently designing a PSU which needs to be reliable, so at the moment I'm using 50V caps for a maximum 20V input (35V caps aren't available), but I'd like to switch to 25V caps if possible.
",Thomas O,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/1225,"You should actually not be comparing ceramics to electrolytics in terms of lifespan at all, they are actually intended for totally different purposes. Most beginners (I did untill recently) think they are just higher values, but they are as different as inductors are to resistors. Mainly because electrolytic values are more approximate, and their value much more temperature dependant than ceramic, polycarbonates or tantalum. Note: Tantalum are very voltage sensitive.

You answer is that I would also use a 50V cap for a 20V supply, in fact if you glance at the charge curve for electrolytics you will notice that they work better (more farads) at about 1/3 of their rating anyway. As for being for different purpose, you will get heating in an electrolytic if you allow it to completely charge and discharge on a cycle, for instance using a 220uF to service a 10 amp load on a rectifier will tax the cap and cause heating in the leads, and as the other answers alread indicate, heating equals less farads.

I'm just an amateur, so no clever math, sorry.

4703,5889,question and answer 9330,What are the implications of Emmet's autonomous movement?,"During The Lego Movie we learn that the whole LEGO world is actually a universe existing within ours, or to be precise, in the basement of a real human family and that the whole story is actually played out by a little boy named Finn and a way for him to cope with the conflict of his strict and fantasy-inhibiting father. And indeed this is again strengthened when we see that the actions as performed by his father when supposedly ""repairing the mess"" that Finn created are directly represented by Lord Business' micromanagers performing them inside the in-universe viewpoint of the other LEGO figures.

Upto this point that is a reasonable and obvious representation to me and even Emmet's direct witness of the universe behind his, our real world, is nothing but him seeing the strips behind the course of his own universe, however he managed to overcome this boundary between dimensions. But the single-most action that completely shatters this whole viewpoint is the incident, when Emmet manages to move completely on his own, thus directly interfering with our universe on his own and it seems to me that there is no way to bring this in congruence to our own physical reality, not even when accepting the LEGO world and its course as an emanation of Finn's fantasy, since Finn didn't do anything at all.

So what are we to make of this incident? Does it have any deeper implications for the depicted realities? Does this establish the LEGO figures as existent and sentient within our physical reality outside of our mere fantasy? Does it have any further signficance for the meaning of the whole story and actually extend the rather simple and obvious kid's fantasy interpretation of the story in a much more elaborate way I have missed? Or is this just to be brushed off as nothing of relevance?
",Napoleon Wilson,https://movies.stackexchange.com/users/49,"I believe Emmet's movements can be explained in a similar way as in Toy Story.  The toys each have an individual personality and autonomy, but those personalities and autonomous actions are affected by the person playing with the toys.

This would mean that a large portion of the movie consisted of the characters acting in and of themselves.  This makes sense if we consider the people making fun of Emmet, as I don't think that was Finn nor his Father.  Furthermore, if we consider the lore of the world (The vortex, the Kragle), these things would make sense if the characters would autonomous, (If a lego person falls off the table, he'll just pick him up).

While it is definitely possible that a child would imagine this on his own, I think it makes more sense that the legos are autonomous all the time, but given personality from the one playing with them.

  $T_0 = 1$
  with probability $1$ and $T_n = \min\{j : X_j &gt; X_{t_{n−1}} \}$ for
  $n\geq 1$. 


Is there a typo in $T_n = \min \{j : X_j &gt;
    X_{t_{n−1}} \}$? Should it be instead $T_n
    = \min\{j : X_j &gt; X_{T_{n−1}} \}$?
For the  record value $R_n$, 


  The record value sequence
  $\{R_n \}$ is defined as $R_n =X_{T_n} , n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. Suppose
  that the $X_j$ ’s are iid geometric
  variables with pmf $$p_x = p(1 − p)^{x−1}, x = 1, 2, ...$$ Then $R_n
    =X_{T_n} = \sum_{j=0}^{n} X_j$ is
  distributed as the sum of $n + 1$ iid
  geometric variables.


why does the second equality in
""$R_n =X_{T_n} = \sum_{j=0}^{n} X_j$
"" hold?
For the process of the record values
$\{ R_n, n \in \mathbb{N}\}$, 


  Each of the following properties
  characterizes the geometric
  distribution: 
  
  (i) Independence: The rv’s $R_0 , R_1  - R_0 , ... , R_{n+1} - R_n ,...$ are independent. 
  
  (ii) Same Distribution: $R_{n+1} - R_n$ has the same distribution as
  $R_0$ . 
  
  (iii) Constant Regression: $E[R_{n+1}- R_n |R_n ]$ is constant.


How to show that the three
properties hold? Are they derived
from the memoryless property of
geometric distribution?

What else can we say about the
process based on the memoryless
property of geometric distribution?


Thanks for your advice!
",Ethan,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/3616,"Your second point looks wrong in the book.  I think
$$R_n = X_{T_n} = X_{T_0} + \sum_{i=1}^n \left(X_{T_i} - X_{T_{i-1}}\right)$$ 
or 
$$R_n = X_{T_n} = R_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n (R_i - R_{i-1})$$
might be better (and obvious).  

Since $T_0 = 1$, $R_0 = X_{T_0} = X_1$, identically distributed as each of the $X_j$. 

This is where the memorylessness of the geometric distribution applies, because it has the property that $R_n - R_{n-1} = X_{T_n} - X_{T_{n-1}}$ has the same distribution as $X_j$ because if $X_{T_{n-1}} = k$ then
$$Pr(X_{T_n} - X_{T_{n-1}} = m) = Pr(X_{T_n} = m+k | X_{T_n} &gt; k) = \frac{p(1 − p)^{m+k−1}}{\sum_{j \ge 1} p(1 − p)^{j+k−1} } = p(1 − p)^{m−1}$$
and is independent of k and of all the $X_j$ for $j &lt; T_{n-1}$ and $j&gt;T_n$

So $R_j - R_{j-1}$ has the same distribution as $X_j$ and combined with independence leads to $R_n$ having the same distribution as $\sum_{j=0}^n X_j$, i.e. 


  as the sum of $n + 1$ iid geometric variables.


as the book says.

I think the book is wrong with its equals sign: two (sums of) random variables can have the same distribution without being the same.  If $A$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$ and $B = 1-A$, then $A$ and $B$ have the same distribution, but they are unlikely to be equal to each other.

4714,5903,question and answer 9349,Equivalent of Java 1.6 @Override for interfaces in C#,"This question gives the answer that Java's @Override has the C# equivalent of the override keyword on methods. However, since Java 1.6 the @Override annotation can be applied to interfaces also.

The practical use for this is that in Java you get compile errors when a class claims it implements an interface method when it no longer does (e.g. if the interface method is removed). Is there equivalent functionality in C#?

Some code examples:

Java:

public interface A {
  public void foo();
  // public void bar(); // Removed method.
}

public class B implements A {
  @Override public void foo();
  @Override public void bar(); // Compile error
}


C#:

public interface IA {
  void Foo();
  // void Bar(); // Removed method.
}

public class B : A {
  public override void Foo(); // Doesn't compile as not 'overriding' method
  public void Bar(); // Compiles, but no longer implements interface method
}

",Bringer128,https://stackoverflow.com/users/545680,"As stated, you cannot get that kind of control from an interface alone in C#. You could get it from an abstract class however. For the purpose of completeness, here is what you could do:

public interface IA
{
    void Foo();

}

public abstract class A : IA
{
    virtual void Foo()
    { }

    // Removed method
    //virtual void Bar()
    //{ }
}

public class B : A
{
    public override void Foo()

If you are well familiar with C++, you may want to read a list of the major differences (e.g., everything is dynamically-bound) and then start practicing on an environment (just download Eclipse). The small differences are the main thing you would have to get adjusted to. 

Now that Java supports generics, one of the major switching pains is gone. Multiple inheritance, while not supported, is not a big deal if you get used to interfaces, and in fact having interfaces rather than abstract classes with PVFs improves readability.

To me Java is a nice and friendly and relaxing sandboxed version of C++. I don't have to worry about GPFs, I don't have to worry about memory leaks, I don't have to worry about messing with pointers. However, don't let that confuse you, there are still plenty of opportunities to screw up royally, and they're sometimes even nastier to detect.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuMngik0GR8 (the diagram is at 1:37)


I've been told the the proprietary drivers offer some extra protection from very short spikes (on power up and shutdown) in the current which laser diodes are very sensitive to and might be damaged from. But isn't the LM317 regulator taking care of that itself already?

I've been told this from people who actually sell commercial laser diodes so I'm thinking they might be showing some bias.
",Leo Ervin,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/75978,"The main issue with the circuit you've shared is transients.

Some linear regulator circuits will tend to overshoot on turn-on, or allow input transients to pass through to the load. Here's the ripple rejection curve for TI's LM317:



You can see that the LM317 will do very little to protect the laser from transients with characteristic times below about 1 us. And an ESD event can easily have a pulse width as short as 1 ns.

And many laser diodes are quite sensitive to over-voltage and over-current. They may also respond very quickly to transients compared to other devices that you might connect to an LM317.

A good laser driver circuit should have ESD protection, transient protection, and a slow-start behavior.

These things are more important if you are driving a low-cost CD laser, or a high-speed telecommunications laser than if you are driving a high-power material processing laser. They may also be less important today than they were 20 years ago due to improvements in the robustness and reliability of newer laser designs.

Keep in mind, the repos on Bitbucket and TFS (versions B and C respectively) have no common git commits, although they both come off the same base version A.

I can see a couple of ways of doing this, not sure of the cons of each though:
1) Add Bitbucket version B as an upstream to my TFS version C, and fetch upstream/master, then do a git diff.
2) Copy the files from version B into the directory that holds version C, and then commit them as if I changed the files manually.
3) Something else entirely, like rebase.

My understanding of git is very basic so please explain like I'm 5 (well, not really, but you know what I mean).

Note: It is ok to have all changes made from A to B in one commit in the final repo history, but would be nice to preserve the individual commits between A and C.

  Clicked links turn purple because blue + ""read"" equals purple


Is there any specific reason why a link is blue and when it is clicked/read, it turns to purple?

Do these colors have any meaning?
",Shevliaskovic,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/41986,"I will give one of the best answers now. 

Ofcourse the colors have meaning.There this flower named as Lupinus Argenteus which is usually blue in color. But after a Bee visits the flower and obtains nectar from the flower, the color changes to purple in a few days. This makes the Bee understand that the flower has been visited and doesn't waste its time in the visited flowers. The same concept is used in this search results where the visited links appear purple and the unvisited links are still blue. This is a way of getting the UI from nature. This is done with a lot of research put into the work.

4765,5968,question and answer 9460,AES using derived keys / IVs. Does it introduce a weakness?,"I'm looking for an efficient way to encrypt multiple fields in a database with AES using a single global key, used throughout a large web application.

Obviously in order to re-use this key, a unique random IV is required for each field that is to be encrypted.

I'd rather not introduce more fields to the database to store each of these IVs, so the programatic approach seems to be to derive these IVs some how.

I'm toying with using either:

key = sha256(global_key + table_name)
iv = sha256(column_name + primary_key)


Or even simply:

key = global_key
iv = sha256(table_name + column_name + primary_key)


I'm leaning towards the former to generate per-table keys.

I've already read that the IVs do not need to be kept secret. So I'm working on the assumption that a derived key or IV (even if the algorithm becomes known), is no more insecure than any other non-secret IV, as long as the original key remains secret.

The question is:

Is there a fatal flaw in my approach? Am I introducing any serious weaknesses that, in the event that an adversary obtains a copy of the database, would make it easier for them to retrieve the plaintext data?

I realise that is potentially soliciting one word answers.

Suggestions for alternate / better schemes very much welcomed, as well as references to existing works and how they implement similar scenarios.
",Leigh,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/1349,"Your approach is insecure.  If you modify some value in the database, you'll be encrypting a new value using the same IV as you used to encrypt the prior value.  (The data will be stored in the same place, so the table name, column name, and primary key will remain unchanged.)  This might compromise confidentiality.  The compromise is especially bad if you are using a stream cipher or AES-CTR or similar mode, as then you've encrypted two different values using the same stream, a classic keystream-reuse vulnerability (the two-time pad is highly insecure).

Instead, it is better to do as others recommend: generate a random IV, and store it together with the ciphertext.  Indeed, in most modes of operation, you can consider the IV to be part of the ciphertext.

4809,6022,question and answer 9556,Proving square root of a square is the same as absolute value,"Lets say I have a function defined as $f(x) = \sqrt {x^2}$. Common knowledge of square roots tells you to simplify to $f(x) = x$ (we'll call that $g(x)$) which may be the same problem, but it isn't the same equation. For example, say I put $-1$ into them:

$\begin{align}
f(x) &amp;= \sqrt {x^2} \\
f(-1) &amp;= \sqrt {(-1)^2} \\
f(-1) &amp;= \sqrt {1} \\
f(-1) &amp;= 1

$\begin{align}
g(x) &amp;= x \\
g(-1) &amp;= -1

thereby, we conclude that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ do not produce the same results even though they are mathematically the same. This is also shown when we try to graph the functions:

$y = \sqrt {x^2}$:



$y = x$:



$y = \mid x \mid$:

",yydl,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/128,"As I've heard it, it involves opening a Tanach to a random verse; I heard something it specifically being some Amsterdam printing of the Tanach (anyone back me up here?).  There are some famous stories about its use, though these may be no more than hearsay:


One rabbi who got the verse, ""do not use witchcraft or divinations!""
When Rabbi Joseph Breuer was ill and needed an additional name, they found the verse ""Shimon and Levi are brothers""; his ""brother"" in leading the KAJ community was Rabbi Shimon Schwab, so he became Levi Joseph Breuer.
I think there's one with R' Aharon Kotlar, debating coming to America in 1941, and finding (Exodus 4:27) ""Hashem told Aharon, go greet Moshe in the desert"", referring to Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (who had made it to America in 1936). H/t Alex (see comments below).

4846,6065,question and answer 9624,My.Computer.FileSystem.DeleteDirectory() with read only files?,"I recently came across a problem with My.Computer.FileSystem.DeleteDirectory(). It will not delete read only files.

I found out by Googling that I could delete the read only files by changing the file attributes to 'Normal'. So I wrote a recursive function, as below.

Private Sub DeleteDir(ByVal dir As DirectoryInfo)

    For Each d In dir.GetDirectories
        DeleteDir(d)
    Next
    For Each f In dir.GetFiles
        Try
            f.Attributes = FileAttributes.Normal
            f.Delete()
        Catch ex As Exception
            Log(ex.Message)
        End Try
    Next
    dir.Delete(True)
End Sub


It seems to work fine, but it would be nice if My.Computer.FileSystem.DeleteDirectory() had another parameter to delete read only files, or there was an easier way to do this.
",Rots,https://stackoverflow.com/users/455770,"My understanding is that the classes in the My namespace are partly meant as a crutch to new developers (possibly with a VB6 background) that finds the .Net framework a bit overwhelming. If they made the My namespace too big, I think it would defeat that purpose of being easier to find things in. I would also assume that they probably had limited resources to build that namespace and had to be quite selective.

The solution is for you to do as you've done and write your own method, which you could then put in a class library or similar together with other helpful helper functions that you can then easily include in all your projects.

Btw, remember that dir.Delete(True) can throw exceptions as well.

4854,6075,question and answer 9643,Adjustment to road bike brakes for high grade downhill,"I have a road bike with a front brake that wears a lot of brake pad when I ride downhill every day. I lose 900ft in elevation on steep grades with lots of stop signs and traffic lights. On top of that, it rains a decent amount and the rim brakes are terrible in that weather. I don't trust them downhill in the rain. Sometimes I just walk.

I feather the brakes going downhill, because otherwise I'm too fast to stop quickly for an errant car.

It'd be nice to not constantly replace pads, and have powerful stopping. How can I make this constant downhill more pleasant?

Thanks. 
",ash,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/14519,"
You can replace the pads (as stated elsewhere).  There are a lot of variations in pad material, and a faster-wearing pad is not necessarily a better braking pad.  Unfortunately, it's hard to find a good selection of pads, and even harder to get good info on which is suitable to which conditions.
You can use your rear brake more, especially for speed control, and save the front for more ""serious"" efforts.  When I'm on a downhill (rarely as steep/long as yours, though) I like to alternate between front and rear brakes for speed control, and I do it more in bursts rather than with steady pressure.  I'm not sure if this is ""approved"" technique, but it's what makes sense to me.
You can install a second set of calipers.  This is often done on tandems, and can be done simply on some bikes/with great difficulty on others.  (Of course, you'd need to figure out how to operate the extra set, without growing a third hand, and you do have to worry a little about the rim overheating.)
You can get disk brakes (though from the war stories I hear here it's not clear that they are really any better in such a situation).

Help me understand why there isn't one screw to rule them all.
",Doug T.,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/321,"First, I really like Eric's answer for practical reasons.  But there is another side to screw head diversity:  Security.

In the end, it's usually a temporary measure.  Once a company invents a new screw, some third party will start selling tools to remove them.  But for a time, any new screw design means the only people who can open your parts are ""certified"" workshops you've given tools to.  Personally I see this a lot in electronic equipment, where the original manufacturer wants some aspect of design kept private or doesn't want after-market mods made to things they sell.  Nintendo is particularly active in inventing new screws.

Examples of security screws include 3-prong Torx variants, and Allen heads with a raised dot in the middle of the screw head to stop standard Allen wrenches from fitting.

If you'd like to see a much more industrial version, find a car which has been booted and look at the bolt.  I've seen circular bolt heads with an off-center circular hollow inside.  No shoulders or slots to grab, you have to have a very specific wrench.  And, of course, there are security lug nuts for car tires.
