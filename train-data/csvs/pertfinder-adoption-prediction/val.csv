To be willing to provide regular updates on their progress during the first 3 months or until they are spayed/neutered. Procedures to be taken care of by me prior to their adoption: *De-flea, deworm, vaccinate (1st dose) I cannot stress enough the importance of neutering and spaying of pets to prevent unwanted litters and ultimately, controlling the stray population. As such, only potential adopters who believe in spaying/neutering their pets OR those who are willing to learn about spaying/neutering will be considered. They will be ready for adoption after they settle down, but I will screen potential adopters now. kittens can be adopted individually or together, I can deliver them to their new home within KL / Klang Valley Area. Please help to share around with your friend, any other rescue community platform will be fine, help them to find a forever home ! Serious adopters only.

She is back in the compound, where the guards are caring for the cats, they are providing food and fresh water. There is also another cat in that age, certainly Bobos sibling.

About the kittens. Currently fostering these two lovelies. Grew up with their momma's milk. Socialised with humans but are a little timid in the beginning, I mean who wouldn't be scared of giants being this tiny right? - Female : black tone, 'manja', replies when you talk, a lil timid at the beginning but gets playful later on, has a unique rough voice. - Male : lighter, more manja, soft meow, loves neck and back rubs. - Both are very healthy and clean. Both grew up together so they are very attached together. Most of the times they are very quiet either sleeping together or exploring together but when they see me, they will start calling and approach careful at first. - Both are around 1.5 months to 2 months old (Jun ) Video and images are attached. I am in Bandar Utama. I prefer whatsapp but calls and messages are fine. :)",9fab4e65f,8,2

He is a cat who lives with dog in a Temple since small. He was trained to play rough by a muscular Judo Master. He acts like dog. Whenever he's tired or nervous, he'll start to breath fast, and stuck his tongue out, like a dog. Juliane (his owner) took Boy home for the first time, Boy barks. Later then he learns to meow. Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention. Every time Kate gets panic attack, that's when the brain will slowly damage. So the more panic attack Kate gets, the more brain damage she'll suffer. Because of Kate's condition, moreover Kate can't see other cat else she'll start to get panic, Juliane decide to put Boy for adoption. Boy is at my place (Bubu's Shelter) now. Though he's big, he's domesticate. When he bonds with you, he'll start suckle your palm. That's how he shows affection. I've train him not to play with human hands, but sometimes he does. But he's a fast learner, so if you show that you're angry when he bites your hand or feet, he'll understand his mistake and stop doing it. So whenever he's hyper, make sure you have toys for him. He has also learn how to socialize. Adopter criteria: I need someone who's confident handling him. Better with experience and someone who's responsible and committed. view video of him suckling palm:",70c811b9d,5,2

Being a cat and all animal lover I thought poor thing, it must have been frightened or felt uncomfortable where she “lived” so decided to come have her kittens in my place. I also assumed she belonged to one of my many neighbours who apparently are “cat lovers or owners”….. the ones who let their cats run about and poo all over the condo area stinking up the area. Anyway I have provided mother and kittens with a safe and clean place to stay. The mother comes and goes, presumably to her owner or to look for food and do her business. Assuming she “belongs” to one of my neighbours I have put up signs on all blocks with pictures attached for the owner to come collect their bundle of fun, also saying “if you don’t I will have offer them up for adoption and/or send them all to SPCA. To date I have not had any replies to my posters. Lately the mother cat does not come back as often as she should and I’m doing my best to “feed” them. I never planned to keep them but just give them temporary shelter till someone claims them or the mother sorts herself out and returns to her own accommodation/owner or starts paying rent :-) Now I offer them to any cat lover/owners. Next step will be to SPCA or any other animal shelter. Attached are some pictures of these adorable kittens.

She has no discernible injuries or health problems, only malnourished. No ticks or fleas. Today, after a few rounds of Whiskas kitten food, a bath and a clean environment, she is bright-eyed and stronger; plays like any normal kitten. She is unafraid of people and loves nothing more than to be with people. She is now toilet-trained on a sandbox. She also does not meow very much, behaves like an intelligent kitten instead of an annoying howler, loves to be petted, purrs an awful lot. Nobody has come forward to claim her, and efforts to find a home for her on FB is still fruitless. Tiggy will be an easy cat to care for, as she is independent yet loving, toilet trained and quite neat. She needs some love and attention, responsible owners who will neuter her and give her the security and care she deserves. I will only be in Malaysia for a few weeks, so am now URGENTLY looking - and hoping - for a home for Tiggy. She deserves better than to be a street cat, left to die or get run over.

I'm trying to find loving homes for the 4 gorgeous puppies we found and rescued late one night in April. We found the puppies abandoned on a hillside behind where we are staying and I'm sorry to say it looked as if they had been thrown there and left. At first we didn't think they would have the strength to survive after the trauma as their eyes were still all closed and they were no bigger than my hand. How wrong I was! They are clearly born resilient and made a rapid recovery. There have been many sleepless nights of bottle feeding the 4 puppies, trust me we've had our hands full! But now I'm really happy to say that despite their rough start they are starting to blossom into the most lovely little puppies with a fantastic temperament. Sadly, I am only in Malaysia traveling visiting family and diving and I am due to return home to the UK very soon. I have looked into relocating the puppies there but at their age it is very difficult to do so and I fear I will not have enough time or funds to relocate them all. With this in mind I am looking to find them loving families that they can grow and be a part of. They have had weekly check-ups at the vets, of which I have put together individual medical history file for each puppy. These happy and healthy puppies have been de-wormed and are in the process of their vaccinations (receiving their first dose .14)...please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to arrange to come and see the puppies. xox 12 PAWS LEFT….!",7e43a342a,5,4

The reason I am now making reimbursement of the breeder's fee compulsory is to help out Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better (MDDB) - they are currently in dire financial straits (read this for details and please help if you can: ). Previously if Donut's adopter voluntarily reimbursed the breeder's fee I had planned to donate the RM to MDDB anyway, since they really need funding I reckon a sincere adopter won't mind the expense as it's going to a good cause. 6th April edit: The family who intended to adopt Donut backed out due to personal reasons (hectic things going on in their lives, nothing to do with Donut herself). So this bundle of beagle-y joy is up for adoption again! :) 5th March edit: I have had people contact me asking if she's old enough to mate. Apparently some people can't read - DONUT HAS BEEN SPAYED. Meaning she can't get pregnant. If you want to adopt her with the intention of breeding her, don't bother contacting me. Donut is an affectionate beagle that loves human and canine company. Trained to do toileting on grass and knows a few tricks - sit, paw, high five, up, down, stand, responds to her name and stays on command in the presence of food. Well socialised and impervious even to thunderstorms (she will calmly snooze under whichever car's in the porch whereas my adult dog will be running around in a panic)! She has some good and bad traits typical of beagles. The good: She's a pack animal as beagles are bred to be and therefore gets along well with other dogs (plays happily with my lab pup and even my temperamental adult mutt). Very friendly even with new people - strangers are constantly delighted when they approach her. The bad: She loves digging holes in the garden (a common problem with beagles). So if you love gardening and your lawn must look immaculate she is not the dog for you. She will also chew stuff you leave lying around which is typical behaviour for all teething puppies. 9th April edit: This isn't necessarily a good/bad thing as it's a natural inclination due to her breed (beagles were originally bred to hunt), but forgot to mention, Donut has a high prey drive when it comes to small animals and cannot be trusted unsupervised with them. She has killed squirrels and birds that wandered into my garden so if you have small animals as pets in your home (rabbits/hamsters/sugar gliders etc.) she would not be a good fit. She's curious and friendly with adult cats when supervised but I would not advise keeping her if you have kittens as I'm not sure if she might mistake them for prey to hunt due to their small size. For those who might wonder why this lovely dog is up for adoption: She is the product of an irresponsible breeder - I'd rather not go into details because remembering how she came into being in my care makes me mad =/ Initially I was hoping to keep her but being a person who believes one should spend a lot of quality time with his/her dog, I've reluctantly come to the conclusion that with 2 dogs of my own I just cannot give Donut the attention she deserves. I spend at least 2 hours a day with my dogs - my opinion is that if you only have time to feed your dog and give it a quick pat as you leave for work/return, then you do not have enough time for a dog. I hope she will find a loving home where love can be lavished on her instead of her present situation where she is receiving limited attention. Adoption fee is for covering her vaccination (she has had the full set of shots) and spaying costs. On top of those expenses I had to pay off the breeder to have Donut released to me (otherwise the breeder would have dumped her at SPCA or pawned her off to the first willing buyer who may have turned out to be a backyard breeder). If you are a serious adopter and able to reimburse me for the breeder's fee (RM) this would be greatly appreciated - I will donate the reimbursed amount to a dog rescue organisation. [PLEASE NOTE the 9th April edit on top of this listing - the breeder's fee is now compulsory.) I am going to be blunt and state upfront that I can afford to be very selective about the home she goes to and will be. After all, pedigreed dogs are more popular (I wish more people would love mixed breeds just as much, but this is the unfortunate reality) and I am in no hurry rehome her. My priority is finding Donut a home where she will receive more love and attention than I can give her at the moment. Bearing the above in mind, these are my conditions for adoption: 1. You MUST have time for her. Donut thrives on attention - when I first fostered her she had separation anxiety and would whine and howl if there were no humans or dogs to keep her company (with training she is now a confident dog). As such I strongly prefer a home where there is a friendly dog for companionship. If Donut will be the only dog in the household, I would prefer if the household has someone able to give her constant attention (i.e. retiree/homemaker/work-at-home/kids). 2. No tying or caging up (unless you find a constantly howling beagle particularly enjoyable....). 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover medical costs and breeder's fee. 4. Patience with destructive behaviour that is inevitable with all puppies. 5. Maintain her on a premium kibble (she is currently on Orijen)/raw food diet. 6. Allow me to visit in the beginning to check on her wellbeing (as such I am looking for adopters in the KL/Selangor area so that this is possible). 7. Lavish her with love, love and more love! :) I would appreciate it if you could email a brief intro of yourself, your experience with dogs if any, which area you live in, your household situation (what type of home you live in, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) and why you would like to adopt Donut. I will get back to you with my contact number for further discussion.",f663a91e8,10,3

I know because she has the loudest mews and I can hear her a few houses away. She was sleeping under cars, ON car tires and IN car engines far too much for my comfort. I keep worrying that she might get trapped in there or get run over one day. So I decided to rescue her and try to find a new home for her. Little Stacey was a lost kitten I think, there weren't other kittens and no female cats around that could look like her momma. She was always alone under cars or in drains. Stacey is a feisty little thing, she will hiss at strangers, but will not usually bite or fight back. She is a very vocal kitten, hyperactive and loves to play with anything and everything. Stacey can be manja at times but most of the time she will prefer to run around curiously to explore every nook and cranny. She had been dewormed, but not vaccinated. Litter trained, and eats Fussy cat wet food + Acana kibbles. Stacey is a brown tabby with no tabby markings on her body, just on the head, legs and tail. The tips of her ears are black, so is her tail, which I suspect is from a Siamese heritage. She has white paws, which is very cute. :) If interested, please e-mail me at or SMS me at.

We thought she was hit as she was so stiff and barely moved. Fast tracking to today.... She has been vaccinated, dewormed and spayed. She has a scar on her tail (indicating a rubberband mark). She is rather timid and has to be an indoor-only cat. She is very loving, prefer rubs rather than hugs so might not do so well with children picking her up. She is okay with other cats and doesnt mind dogs (*have to be introduced properly) (**cat-friendly dogs only).

I've only had one loving owner but since she's moved, the management of her new condo does not allow the keeping of pets. So I am hoping to find a new kind owner who is willing to adopt me. My owner has already vaccinated and de-wormed me. I've always been kept indoors so I am very healthy without any disease or ticks. I also know basic tricks like sit, stay, come, down, roll, paw (shake hand) and fetch. I hope to find a new family that will love me and that I can love back. If possible a family that will keep me indoors and not caged. If this sounds like you and you are located in KL area, please do contact my owner. I promise that I will try to be a good and loyal doggie. Please adopt me. Love Always, Oreo P/S: My current owner also has a doggie cage, toys, chew snacks, and dog food which she is willing to give away FOC to my rescuer. She will also send me for full grooming before handing me over. =========================================== Additional info about Oreo - Oreo is 90% toilet trained. He goes outside at the laundry area where I put newspapers. But sometimes he leaves me little “presents” in the house. - I don’t cage Oreo at all so he’s not used to be locked up in a cage. - Oreo stays home most of the time but I will bring him out at least once every two weeks. He loves being in the car and is very well behaved. Never did ""business"" in the car before or get car sick. - If Oreo knows that there's someone in the house he generally doesn't bark at all, but he will bark a bit if he's left alone in house. - Oreo is more ""sticky"" compared to my previous dogs. He will follow you around the house no matter what you are doing. So he's not the type that will only come to you if you have food. - Currently I feed Oreo dried dog food (Blackwood) mixed with either canned dog food or some rice + leftovers. - Oreo's fur does get much longer (can probably touch the floor) than in the photos. I kept it short on purpose as it is easier to maintain. - Oreo sleeps alone outside in the living room area, he's not allowed in the bedroom.",8f15fc3d8,11,1

In addition, I am partially allergic to pet dander, which is a skin rash condition that flares up if exposure is prolonged.

Josie is also already weaned, now eating Iskhan (holistic Korean) kitten kibbles and also wet canned food.

It would be good if you can keep her in the house or in the house compound instead of in the cage because she's not the kind of cat you keep inside a cage, she'd get depressed and become rebellious.

She is sadly Heartworm positive and will be treated for it..She was officially fostered on the 13th of Feb and will be under the care of a very kind samaritan for 2 months. We hope a suitable person would come forward to welcome her with open arms with a forever home..we know she is at that age but has been through a lot. Can you imagine having a choke collar on yourself, your whole life? See the 'rafia' tied on her choke collar? Yes, I got it snipped off and hopefully the fosterer would be able to get her choke collar off. What is wrong with human beings! The Starbucks trip could wait, Starbucks won't go anywhere. Even if one Starbucks gets demolished, more would appear..But there are billions of animals in need and there will always be one buddy or clara or we will call her every loving name in the entire world!..Just like there is only one of us out of the billions of people out there. If you want a dog that is just there as an accessory or if you just want a dog that is healthy, I guess you don't have to read further but I hope the least you could do is place yourself in her shoes and share about her. I been asked if her chances of being adopted is high. I don't have a crystal ball people, I'm not God either so your question is bizarre to me, but as bleak as it may seem to many of you, I want to remain hopeful that a responsible and caring adopter would come forward wanting to care for her like a child who would stand by their elderly parent with ailments. Buddy was sent to me I believe..God had a task for me on that day. That day where a man cockily rang the bell and asked me to place water for the dog. Of course I would though I was put off by him. Man claimed dog followed him from the bus stop but he was reluctant to stay even for one minute with the dog while I gathered the food, the water? Doesn't click. Dog wanders up and down..people, hah, people were so unkind in general. I could go 'excuse me sir, excuse me, excuse me maam' and what? They just ignored me. To top it off, employer appeared displeased with the dog's presence, but adviced on placing food at the bus stop and just letting her wander off. If one knows me well enough, such 'advices' goes into into my left ear, out through my right ear. I made calls in secrecy. Managed to find a neighbour of this kind couple who housed her for two nights. 8 am the next day, I had to collect her. Would be at work with me but I was only allowed to place her outside of the clinic (yup, I work in an animal clinic indeed). Imagine the scorching heat, imagine the thunder, the rain and I couldn't. Mind you, couldn't even board her. Not because I had no money. I was simply not allowed to. As shitty as that was, good thing, I went by what I stood for and I wasn't a moron to listen to such advices. I've my own personal values. I would have slept with her outside of the clinic at night if that was what it took even because no way was I going to leave her to fend for herself. Thankfully a kind lady contacted me through the internet and agreed to foster her for 2 months. So again fellow Malaysians or expats or people holidaying here etc, before you go for your next Starbucks fix or debating on what clothes to buy, please take a moment and reflect on this. The fosterer and me are really hoping we could find a suitable person to give her a permanent home...We want the end of her days to be filled with love, compassion... If you are that person, please contact me Yasmin at. Its best for you to sms me first because I work such long hours. More pictures and any necessary updates will be provided. We can't predict what will happen within this two month period but..we do need fosterers as a back up.. So please, we could end up like Clara..alone, lost, left to wander about when we're old, hoping for the mercy of another human being. Think about it. Someday, we could be sitting outside of Starbucks, begging for dough..from the outside, looking in and all of the 'too caught up with the Starbucks buzz' people who reminded you of yourself when you were younger would all turn a blind eye at you and hey, remember back then that dog you didn't want to give your time for? Reality would blow you real hard when you see a dog wandering on the streets, comforting you. Just think about it. Its no Hollywood script. Its reality. Think about it. If what I just wrote does hit you somewhere, then hit me up. Otherwise, just turn the page. Kindly, Yasmin",f3b52a69c,4,2

He has on a frayed yellowish collar, so he could've been lost for a while, as he's also very skinny, and he's already neutered when found. Estimated age to be about 1 year old, as he still pees like a gal and has young teeth and good skin. Found in Ara Damansara, though he could've come from anywhere if he's been lost for sometime. He knows how to sit, shake hand and come. He can walk off-leash following people (those who show kindness to him). He sits well in the car. VERY PEOPLE FRIENDLY (so must've been treated very well by humans during his early months). He was hanging around near an unoccupied house in the residential area with the two other dogs despite occasionally being beaten by one particular resident who dislike ""strays."" They also take shelter at a nearby field in the residential area. They've been roaming the area probably since December . If nobody claims him in a week, we'd like to have him adopted! This is a dog that will reward it's keepers with affection and guarding of family property! He is kept at a neighbour's house for a few days, and he will bark at unknown passers-by and unknown cars parked near the house. Would be great if adopters take in another of his buddies from the streets too. He loves attention and freedom. When chained, will whine CONTINUOUSLY for attention if he knows that dog-lovers are within hearing distance. When left to roam free within the compound of the home, he's a real darling! He's quiet, he naps, he's playful when people are around, he's alert when he sees strangers - the perfect dog for a family who'd spend time playing and running/walking him! He makes a wonderful companion dog as well as an alert dog (eg. alert family of possible intruders). Would be great if new owners can take in 2 or more pets. We've taken in this lovely dog and his 2 companions, and he seems to love having other dogs around! Note: SAFE AROUND CATS! He's curious in chasing and approaching them, but non-agressive and stays 2 feet away from usually hissing cats that he approaches! update on: 1st Feb Open for adoption!!! This darling doggie is now kept with another stray who appears to be the ""brother"". The brother was found intact, and when they first started roaming Ara Damansara, was average in weight. however, after roaming for over a month (as sighted by rescuer), he got skinnier and skinnier. The brother is very good on leash, hardly barks, just wags tail when see loving humans and doesn't jump. would be great if a family can adopt BOTH DOGS, as they tend to be happier and quieter and get to play together.",b857d5ac6,6,3

Has marbled fur and beautiful orange eyes. Father was a pure Maine Coon and mother a DLH (see final pics). ♥ Surrendered to us with a rather bad fungal issue several months back which he has since fully recovered from. He is now seeking a suitable new family. Character: ♥ Ferauni is a frisky boy who adores people to bits - however he will need time to adjust to both a new environment + new cats (as long as they are not aggressive). Constant attention and the presence of humans round the clock makes this process a quick one. ♥ When he's not rolling on the sofas purring, acting cute or asking for belly rubs - he LOVES to play. Feather and string toys are his favourite and he has quite some speed and jumping skills to show off. He even ""coo-s"" and knows how to speak (meow) back when spoken to. ♥ Ferauni loves being cuddled to sleep. He's still learning to stay put while being carried (normally jumps off) but otherwise parks himself super close to us whenever possible. He is very responsive to being called and follows us everywhere around the house. ♥ Ferauni is healthy (has completed two vaccine shots + two Revolution spot on treatments, aside from his medical maintenance). He is very clever with the litter-box and not fussy at all about dry or wet food. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Ferauni must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments must be cat-safe. ○ Neutering is a MUST when he's older. There are far too many homeless kittens out on the streets. ○ Ferauni would prefer premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire if unsure, this is for his long term welfare. ○ A reimbursement FEE will apply for his partial medical cost + neutering deposit, please inquire.

I strayed too far from my mom-cat and like all lost kittens, I meowed / called out for days. Foster mummy heard my meowing from afar. I wasn't aware of it at the time, but she was trying (in vain) to look for me. ♥ Then came one stormy and rainy evening. I somehow found my way to foster mummy's backyard. I called out again, and this time foster mummy came outside, determined to rescue me. Boy did I protest hard when she laid her hands on me...hissing, screaming, biting at her gloves! She eventually wrapped a towel around me and everything went dark. ♥ I was brought to a quiet room, where the scent of kibbles greeted me. There were several bowls of food and fresh water laid out. I didn't stop to think about anything else, I went straight for my first proper meal in days! ♥ I didn't let foster mummy have it easy. The very sight of her walking into the room each day would send me running to a corner (I even urinated a few times out of fear). Still, she remained patient and kept talking to me in a calm voice. She began bringing me treats during each visit and this is when I really started to open up. ♥ Fast forward a week ahead, here I am! Any person who sees / handles me today would find it hard to believe that I was once a wild / feral kitten. I purr at the very SIGHT of people and I LOVE being petted, carried, belly-rubbed, you name it! I'm gentle when I play too (no claws) and my favorites are string-toys and anything bushy / crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, etc). ♥ Foster mummy has already taken me to the vet for my first full check-up. I was de-wormed and given a clean bill of health. Now I'm ready for that special / permanent family to share my life with! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ◘ Max-A-Million would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age. ◘ Max-A-Million would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

Please read on to understand more about me."" -------------------------------------------------------------------- Details: - Female, 2 years old, pure American Curl with gorgeous blue eyes. Character: - Meshira is a sweet little creature, loves long hours of stroking and pampering. She is super clingy (will tag alone everywhere and squeeze into sofa space with her humans). She has a very kitten like personality despite her age, she can be very playful and fun. - Meshira has a tendency to get overexcited during petting / play and sometimes play-bites. She knows how to inhibit herself however and understands a simple firm ""no"" in such circumstances. - Meshira gets along with other sociable / aloof adult cats (those that aren't aggressive) and kittens. She can adjust to dogs as well. Territorial or aggressive adult cats are a big no. - Meshira has been vaccinated, dewormed and spayed. She's not at all fussy about food and is good with the litter box. *** Note For Potential Adopters (PLEASE READ) *** - Meshira ""nips"" as a show of affection hence adult owners or homes with older children preferred (seasoned cat people). - She needs a % indoor home. No apartments (unless you have maintained a cat-safe environment for many years). - Premium diet must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Please drop me a text (WhatsApp) if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this girl home. Thank you!",d350f881f,10,3

It was raining heavily and the little kitten was all wet and hungry. I waited for hours to see any sign of the mother cat but there is none. So I believe that the little kitten is abandoned by the mother cat. Anyway, I managed to catch the little kitten and currently he/she is in the cage. I am still unable to hold the little kitten as he/she is still afraid of human contact. So, I am unable to know the little kitten's gender yet. My hunch is that the little kitten is a female :) I am looking for any potential adopter who is willing and kind enough to adopt this little kitten. The potential adopter has to be very patience with this little kitten as he/she is afraid of human. I believe that with tender loving care and patience, the little kitten will turn out to be a wonderful companion for the potential adopter. So, if any of the genuine adopter who is willing and able to care for this little kitten, please give me a call . Thank you. 1/3/16 Its been a week since I rescued this kitten and I found out that she's really a female and so I named her ABBIE. She's still wary of strangers but she's comfortable with me to the extend that she allows me to carry her on my lap and clip her nails. I hope that as time progresses, she will be more open to her surroundings and other people. 4/3/16 I think the kitten is male now that I have seen a little 'hump' near his rear end. So I am changing his name from Abbie to Aggie. 😊 9/3/16 Aggie is doing very well and quite playful. Hope he will get a new family soon.",0d653b602,12,4

The reason I am giving him up for adoption is because the place I live in is very unsuitable for him. There are too many stray cats in my area and Jasper has come home too many times after being involved in serious cat fights. I have had to take him to the vet hospital so many times as an emergency case because of his fighting. I tried to keep him indoors and not letting him go out, but he got very depressed and wasn't interested in anything anymore. He loves to go out and sit in the sun and to roll in the grass. However, where I live, the place is very dangerous and there are hardly any fields for him to run and play at. I am looking for someone who seriously loves and understands cats. It is very important that the area you live in should have a field/park as close to the house as possible, or hopefully, your housing area is safe and clean. He needs to go out into the field and play, otherwise he gets very cranky if you only lock him indoors. Jasper is a very loving cat, very chubby and fat. He's almost 6 kg. He loves people and loves to be petted. Also, he's a vegetarian. He only eats cat biscuits, nothing else. Not chicken, fish, prawn, etc. He's also trained to use the cat litter. But he has a weak immune system, and he's prone to getting a flu often. So if you are interested in Jasper, you also need to know that he needs a booster every week. It's a small bottle (about RM49) and it can last a few months. You only need to put 7ml of it in his mouth once a week, so that Jasper doesn't get the flu. I am only looking for serious adopters who will take very good care of Jasper and will love him very, very much. He's a very special and a beautiful cat. If you are interested, please email me at or you can send me a FB message at",9a591a8d9,3,3

She's been with me since about a month ago. I found her the first time when she was a newborn, she was abandoned by her mother together with 4 of her siblings. She was then rescued by a guy that lived in the ground floor (while I live in 7th floor). After around a month I didn't see her, she suddenly came to me when I was waiting for the lift in the ground floor. I just played with her for a minute and then leave because I think she was still belong to the guy (but the fact is that all the kittens was already released by him). The next morning I found her in front of my door and then she directly ran into my unit, until now I don't know how can she reached the 7th floor and found my unit but I decided to keep her with me. She is a very active and playful kitten. She has a beautiful pattern around her face that makes her looks so pretty! She is okay with warm water so its not difficult to bath her. Sometimes she can become so spoiled and demanding for me to pet her until she fell asleep (if I didn't do it she will keep chasing me).

Michi is male, small size, half-short tailed, about 3 years old, and healthy (no skin deseases). He is quiet, sweet, adorable, not picky with his food, and most importantly LOW MAINTAINANCE. It's hard for me to leave him, as he's the most caring thing I have seen in cats. We had great adventures: we hitch-hiked for two days from somewhere near Tawau, to get here. So you can add ""well traveled"" to his qualities. I must leave KK by Sat 11th Aug. Still after this date, please contact me, as I may not have found a place for him. Do you think you can give him a second chance? You can also help by sending this page to your friends Have a look at more pictures of Michi Terima Kasih!",1e011d469,5,1

Can you please be my master and give me a forever home? My name is Lucy. I'm a 4-year old female Pinscher crossbreed, and I'm lucky to be alive. Earlier this year, I was captured by DBKL officers and put in the dog pound. I was scheduled to be euthanized, until me and 60 other dogs were rescued by a local animal welfare association. Our story even made it into the newspapers :-) Nobody knows my past before that, but everyone says I used to have a master because I know how to sit on command! After I got rescued, a couple from Bandar Utama tried taking me into their home. I love them and I love my new home, but I can't get along with their siberian husky. The couple has been trying for months to socialize me, but it's not working and they're forced to keep me separated most of the time from them and the husky. Everyone's best guess is that I got bullied while I was in the dog pound, so I just can't share a space with other dogs. The couple says it's unfair for me to spend so much time in isolation, so they need to find me a new forever home. I love people and kids. I love to chase my ball. I'm not fussy with my food. I'm vaccinated but not neutered. I'll lie on my belly for hours and let you tickle me. I'm happy to stay outside. And I'll guard your house with my life and bark whenever a stranger shows up. All I ask for in return is your unconditional love, and that I be kept in a one-dog household. Would you like to be friends? Take me home maybe?

He's a very friendly and happy boy who loves being petted and hugged, and gets along easily with people and other pets. He's also toilet trained to do his business indoors (on a pan) although he will prefer to do his business on grass if he can. Once he trusts you, if you go out for walks, he will follow you around without a need a for lease and will not disturb other passerbys (unless they disturb him, which is a normal reaction for dogs). He knows his name and usually comes when you call, even stands without running when showered. Romeo would make a wonderful companion for families with children or anyone who does not want an overly active dog. He's spayed and had his first vaccination. He has also proven himself to have a strong will to live and enjoy life because early in January , he was found (by me) lying on the street, completely paralysed and injured quite badly. He had gotten into a bad dog fight, suspected to be over a female in heat (hence the name, Romeo!). At the time, Romeo could not move his whole body and only could slightly move his head and needed help even to eat. During that time, he proved his intelligence by toilet training himself to go to the right pee/poo spot in my house just by observing my other dogs! Even when he couldn't stand properly, he would crawl over to the pee pan and do his business. After a few months of physiotherapy and love, thankfully now he can walk and run very well, although not perfectly and he also cannot jump (e.g. over drains, etc). Even with his limitations, he loves every chance he gets to go out and walk around, while at home, he will come to you for love and attention, giving you a silly happy derp face that you can't help but fall in love with! :) By the way, just because he cannot move completely normally does not mean he will not defend you and your house, as he will bark at potential danger, just like any loyal dog would! This happy boy who has a second chance at life is looking for a loving adopter with a big heart to give him a good home! Location in Subang Jaya",19af88854,10,4

I offered to take it in to PAWS. Not knowing PAWS was closed on Wednesdays we then took the pup to the VET who confirmed she is a girl, healthy looking and between 7 to 10 days. We have been looking after her since Wednesday afternoon. She has been feeding very well and her urine and motion looks very healthy. She is very happy with her little tail wags and wriggling around the box. However, we live in a condo and due to personal/business life we are unable to look after or raise a dog. However, we do not want her to be put down or sent to shelter where she will most likely not survive. The poor little girl needs someone to hand raise her and give her the love and care she needs. If the right home for her needs financial support for her injections/vet/spade I am happy to help. **Update - it's been 5 days since I posted this and she is a super happy dog... lots of tail wags, she is very healthy...

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. (3) Please DO NOT delete my all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. (4) This listing is dated 2 March . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. (5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) Please do not adopt the puppies from us and resale them. We have lots of contacts. If you are trying to sell these puppies, we will know & we will catch you. (7) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 7 points, please read on:- (8) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. (9) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email):- - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with: - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before (10) No reservations please. First come first served. (11) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ husband/ aunt etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way.

We weren't sure if she would bite, but luckily she didn't. Carried her out and she was very weak and was also probably in shock. She couldn't even stand. Then a lady came down from the apartments across the road and told us that she had fallen in yesterday. She had put in some bags of leaves and grass (swept by MPAJ) to try and get her to get out, but she just lay on top of the bags and refused to climb out. So the lady fed her yesterday and had come to feed her again today. She was very worried cause no one she knew would help her. Anyway, we have taken her to the vet, and he has discovered that she has recent trauma to her right eye - some internal bleeding. She doesn't seem to have any broken bones but he is worried that there may be some internal damage. So we have taken a blood sample to check and he has given her some meds to support her internal organs while waiting for the results.

Always the first one to greet us whenever we pay the brothers a visit. And when we leave, Coffee will escort us to the car, seeing him standing there in the rear-view mirror as we drove off breaks our hearts every time.. Living outside the food court, Coffee and his brother Milo are often being bullied and beaten by the food court employee. They were abandoned there when they were pups, despite not getting enough food, they are always being beaten by the food court staff, they stayed on, as that is the only place they know. Young Coffee is extremely trusting and friendly like any pups should. Coffee is neutered, vaccinated, deticked and dewormed. However, due to shortage of place to keep them, Coffee and his brother Milo had to be released to the food court after visit to the vet. The heavy traffic and unfriendly human around is not a safe place for these sweet pups. We pray for the kind person to give this poor kid a real home before it's too late...

Much appreciated. --------------------------------------------- His story : 25th May As we returned home from work, as we pass through Puchong we saw a cage left outside the old veterinary clinic of St Angels Puchong. There it was a Cairn Terrier alike and her 6 puppies. Very highly possibly a dumping case from a backyard breeder. Her puppies looks like just a few days old. Trapped in a small rusty cat cage, matted hair, smelling horrible and poo all around the cage. If we leave them there, they will have no chance at all. So home they went with us. When we arrived home, it was further proven that she once had an owner, is trained and is used for breeding. She walks on leash like a trained dog and knows exactly what to do. Initially, she was a little fierce as she must have been in so much fear. After some time, she calmed down a little more. Marnie has got very badly matted hair all over her and very bad tick infestation. Showered and shaved off all her fur. Due to her being around her puppies we do not dare to use too strong of a tick shampoo on her, hence more on manually removing them slowly. She is around 6 years old, puppies are not more than 2 days old. Her legs appears to be very weak, doctor says she is being caged all the time type. So it's most probably used for breeding before this. B2 is one of Marnie's puppies. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",fa87afa7d,2,2

Believe me, he's a really sweet guy! Here's his story: Ara was found along Jalan Cempaka in Kg Sg Kayu Ara on 18th April, , with a wire cable wrapped tightly around his left hind leg. It had cut almost to the bone and rendered the leg useless. He was rescued and taken to a vet. Thankfully, as Ara was rescued early enough, there was no infection and the leg was saved. It is now almost healed and there does not appear to be any long-term damage to it. In fact, Ara is now able to put his weight on the leg and run, jump (he is an amazing jumper!), and play just like any other dog. Ara was at a fosterer’s since 21st April, , but his resources are stretched as he has his own dog. Therefore, he has since been sent to PAWS Animal Welfare Society on 3rd June . Between the vet and the fosterer, Ara’s mild case of tick fever was also addressed. We urge any kind soul to adopt Ara and bring him home with you. He's a well-mannered and friendly dog with a penchant for playing with balls and shuttlecocks. He is easy to bathe and walk and is good with children, including young ones. From his behaviour and mannerisms, Ara was likely someone else’s pet before, but he is also very street smart now, no doubt due to his time as a stray. Please give Ara a home if you can. We really hope he doesn’t have to go back to being a stray. Thank you for your consideration, and please share! You may visit him at PAWS. Please quote his tag number as listed next to his name at the top of this page to the staff at PAWS.

""Hey there! A nice lady found me in Nilam Terraces in Puchong sometime in end April. She asked the neighbourhood guards about me but no one knew who I belonged to and the guards said I'd been wandering around for 2 weeks. The nice lady posted flyers around the area and asked all the Puchong vets about me but after 3 weeks no one has claimed me. So my carer who has a fondness for anime decided to call me Chibi (""small"" in Japanese) and help me look for a new home. I may be small in stature (only 6kgs!) but will readily bark to alert you to someone at the door! I love to be snuggled - belly rubs are the best! I'm good with other dogs and like playing with small to medium dogs. I have sensitive skin so I hope my human will feed me a good quality diet. I do my potty on the grass or near drainhole covers - my carer thinks I was previously an indoor dog and perhaps potty trained to wee in the bathroom :) Since my past is unknown, I haven't been sent for neutering but please do the responsible thing and spay me after I go on heat if that happens. I'd really like to spend many happy days cuddling on the couch with someone who will tickle my ears and kiss my little apple head - are you the one for me?"" Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to partially cover vaccination, deworming, heartworm test/prevention, tick + flea prevention and skin treatment. 4. If she is found to be intact (i.e. goes on heat), spay after her heat cycle ends. 5. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 6. Unconditional love :) To help determine if you and the dog you're interested in are a good fit, would appreciate it if you could email with: - A brief intro of yourself - Your experience with dogs if any - Your household situation (what type of home you live in i.e. landed or apartment, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) - Any other pertinent info that will help match you with the right pooch :)",43b277272,6,3

I dont think Bobby was a stray cats before since he is very cuddle and didnt run away when I came to him closer. But from his condition, I knew he has been abandoned by his previous owner for a quite long time at these area. Disebabkan ada banyak anjing di kawasan ni selepas jam 3 pagi, (itu pun jiran2 sekeliling yg bagitau sbb sy baru berpindah ke sini) sy amek keputusan untuk bawak ke rumah saya. His fur has been shaved because of hairball here and there, and also has been neutered. Bobby still in recovery process but he is healthy and eat a lot, his fur is getting softer than before because I give him a salmon oil and special food for his fur and his body getting heavier as well :) I would love to keep him as my pet, but I already have five cats in the house.

Mosu Mosu is a mama cat. Her AGE is UNKNOWN. She has pointed colour. Like the siamese. But she is most probably mixed breed. Has blue eyes. She suddenly appeared where we live. So it only means one thing. She's either lost or like most pretty cats that end up here...abandoned. Mosu Mosu is special compared to other cats. Why is a cat like her out here on the streets ?!? She definitely must have been a house cat before. She is very affectionate, gentle and slightly cowardly dealing with other cats but very friendly. She gets attached to humans very quickly. She has never scratched or bit us. but once when I was unconsciously jiggling my house keys, she scratched me accidentally while trying to catch the keys.No wounds. so she plays too I guess. She trusts us waaaay too much. She got herself attached here and when she got pregnant she glued herself here. She behaves absolutely like a house cat ! Seems more intelligent than any other cats here. Maybe due to her mixed breed genes ? -Very well behaved and understands when we say ""no"". -When we let she uses the litter box. When we close it she goes outside to do her ""business"" I'm pretty healthy and had no signs of allergies so far despite having so many stray cats around. But lately I've gotten really sick. It seems I am allergic to Mosu Mosu. She's too furry. Only the mama cat(Mosu Mosu) makes me sneeze and have runny nose. But Mosu Mosu is attached to us and hates and refuses to socialise with other outside cats. So I am hiding the fact that she is making me sick from my family. So I need someone to at least help foster her or something because I don't want to send her to places like PAWS or SPCA.

Yes all his stuff will be provided: -his favourite kibbles -his favourite wet food -his favourite treats -his towel, shampoo, conditioner, brush -his vitamins Anything he needs i will provide and i usually send him for full grooming once in 2 months or once a month depending on the weather. Like now its blazing hot so i will send him for grooming before giving him to the fosterer. If there is anyone interested let me know and of course i would need to scan through the fosterer as Zorro means a lot to me. If you are planning to get a dog for a pet but not sure if you can handle well this is your chance to have a pooch at ur place temporary to see if dogs suitable for u.. Zorro is a sweet dainty little dog.. He can be quite shy with strangers but once he is used to u, he can be very hyper when he wants to play. Though he is 5 years old, he can still behave like an excited puppy. He loves jumping around and skipping..He loves to 'lepak' in a small space like under his cage or the washing machine or the couch. He is very alert when i call for him and he knows quite a number of commands like sit, down , stay , no , in etc but his signature trick is ""malu"" and that's when he'll cover his eyes with his paws.Since he is a smart fella, i believe there are still room for him to learn new things.. Whenever i take him for a walk i dont need a leash bcoz he wont stray far for me and it will always be him who wants to go back inside. He is only meant for serious adopter who is a genuine animal lover looking for a lifetime companion. I would appreciate much if I could send him to his new home if there is any kind-hearted soul out there willing to take him and make him part of your family.",85fd5df90,2,4

We will be charging RM which is the total sum of his medical fee. 4) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. 5) Provide necessary medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 6) Adopter must add us on Facebook so we can receive his progress update. 7) We would like to view the condition of your home before deciding. 8)During the initial stage of adoption, allow visitation so we can ensure Mikey is adjusting well to his new environment. For this reason, adopter residing in Klang Valley is highly preferred. 9) Approval for this adoption is only for the successful adopter.

We took her in when she was approximately 4 months old and only realize she was partially deaf when she was 5 months old. She has been trained using hand gesture and understand Sit, Stay, Down, and Come. If you intend to adopt her, please read up on how to manage a partially deaf dog. She relies on her nose and can smell you from far away, even without seeing you! She has been spayed in December . She does not have any known allergy and is healthy. She has good appetite and likes kibble or any food (as long as healthy). She is friendly, affectionate, plays well with humans and dogs. She is rather active and is destructive when bored. She's not a guard dog at all. She is wary of strangers at first. If you are keen to adopt her, please send us a message to describe: 1. Your experience handling dog (if any) 2. Is your family supportive of the adoption? 3. How much time can you spend with her daily? 4. Are you financially stable and committed to care for her? 5. Can you describe the environment and lifestyle she will have if she goes to you? 6. Are you agreeable to send us updates (photos) every now and then after adoption? Thank you for choosing to adopt. Adoption fee of RM to cover for spaying while the remaining RM medical expenses is sponsored by us. Those who do not answer the questions will be ignored. Thank you.",ee8518e4c,8,4

Both are females, siblings, and high intelligent and easy to train. They are also pretty energetic given their bloodline (Golden retriever cross x Lab retriever cross). They have already been trained to be quiet and they will only bark when approached by strangers entering the compound. They are good natured and friendly. Both are spayed.

Nicole Suresh and Elton Joshua spotted him a couple of days ago and assumed that he belonged to someone in the area who had let him out, and so didn't think much of it. But then I saw him standing in the middle of the road this afternoon as I was on my way home from the vet with my Cleo and Brownie in the car. So I raced home to drop them off, picked Nicole Lee and Elton up, and drove out again to find him. It was raining and we were worried about the poor boy. We managed to find Thor after about 20 minutes whimpering in the rain. He ran for his life when we approached him, but then when he realised that we were just trying to help he came up to us albeit cautiously. After bribing him with a can of Cesar dog food, he decided that we were his best buddies, jumped into the car quite happily. Please call us at or if this is your dog. If he isn't please share this with all your friends so that we can reunite him with his family. We have already taken him to the vet for a check up.

Thank you! : D Roma was rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . After a month of fostering him to ensure that he is in good health and well socialised, he is now ready to be rehomed. - He was dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM9) & 12 September (RM6) at a total cost of RM15. - He has been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding him with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - I regularly trimmed his nails, cleaned his face with a saline solution and ears with Ilium Oticlean solution. - His weight is 0.55 kg as at 12 September . - He's eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - He drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - He has been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM50. - His behaviour is perfect as a pet as he's completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. He's friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept him too) as he's well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Roma's future when you return to your home country. 2) Roma must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM65 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Roma. If possible, adopt Roma at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Roma, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first.

He's litter trained and very adaptable to the type of litter used (clumping clay, crystal, Okoplus). Food wise, he's not at all a picky eater but we feed him with either Royal Canin or LV fit 31. We send him for grooming every fortnight and I myself had groomed him once in a while and he enjoys getting baths.

He is careful of new situations as much as he tests them, and once he warms up, he can skip over at his humans better than the fastest bunny. He's our favourite boy and it took a lot of heart to place him for adoption - heavy purrer (he'll sound like an engine!) and especially loves being stroked and kissed while carried. He can be a lap-cat when relaxing (not while he's busy playing of course, he'll jump off). Also enjoys being shown around the house. ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Christian must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets.

I believe that she was born by a mother of jack russell breed but I can't confirm. Many called in to ask if she is a PURE breed, but sad to say that she is what she is. Whether a pure breed or not, it is still going to be a very good companion dog anyway. She is going thru house training where it is trained to pee/poo on a same spot (old news paper) and not to bite anything that comes into her way (a dog's nature). She is very playful and human friendly. She will definitely loves you with everything she has got if you treat her with love. This one I can guarantee! She is suitable to be kept as a house pet rather than a guard dog (tied up just to guard the house). I believe every single animal on earth deserves to live with freedom, no body likes to be locked up. Those who respect life, loves dog and able to provide love instead of just food and shelter are welcome to adopt Milo. Thanks :) -------------------------------------------------- Rescued from somewhere near my house at Balakong. Found a total of 6 of them yesterday when I drove pass the area. 4 of them felt into a drain and were soaking wet. Me and my wife quickly take them out and found that they were abandoned by a irresponsible owner. They all inherited this jack russell's look leading me to think that they are all from a jack russell mother. Both of them with brown patches around their heads and fully white body. 4 of them were adopted by my neighbours and now left with 2. They are urgently in need of a home as we are only able to foster them until July as we will be away for few weeks for an oversea trip. Besides that, we have got 4 dogs already at home, could not afford to keep another 2 in. I hope some of you dog lovers out there can provide a home for these 2 lovely puppies. They are very healthy and ready to be rehomed. We bought them for first vaccination today and from the guess of the vet, they should be around 1-2 months old. Perfect for someone who is looking for a young puppy where you can start to build the relationship and bonding with them. They are both very active and playful. You may refer to the attached videos :). Thank you very much!",8f1bdc253,2,2

I did not have the heart to leave it there as I saw no signs of its mother nearby. So I took it home and fed it with some food and gave it a quick wash. I went to the vet next day and bought a bottle and milk for cats and it has been drinking from the bottle. Not only is he playful and adorable, he is also quite clever as he has been pee-ing at the same place (in a shoe box laid with newspapers). He is always cleaned afterwards. A very friendly and active little guy, purrs almost all the time now especially after being fed (even knows where he can get his milk from!). Unfortunately, my wife and I are not able to look after him as we are both working until late night. We would like to find a home for this little guy, with or without a foster mother cat, as he can already be fed using a bottle, and can already eat soft food. As much as we are already attached to this little fella, we know that being in a house with caring people to look after him, he'd be much better off without a couple of busy people like us. And we would be happy to see him grow with love and become a handsome cat. ----- Updating again after we gave Sim away to his new family. My husband and I cried our eyes out from missing him last night. I still feel all choked up when I look at his pictures and videos. The night my husband brought him in, we didn't have anything suitable to feed a kitten with but an ikan goreng. As desperate as he was, we had to give him something to eat, so ikan goreng it was. And a few drops of Dutch Lady's full cream milk. The next day, we had only planned to drop him at a local vet, in hoping that a good samaritan would take him in, but the clerk said they don't take animals in, so we ended up buying the little fella a bottle and 2 boxes of milk for cats. Since then we had been feeding him the milk. We left Sim at home and when we came back later that night, we saw him sitting quietly at one spot. And we also saw spots of white vomit and yellow-ish liquidy stool. After immediately cleaning him up, Sim looked sleepy. I thought he might be tired from vomiting like humans would. So I wrapped him up and cuddled him. After a while, I thought something was strange about him. Usually he would wake up if there was even a slight movement, this time he didn't even stir. I also noticed that he squirted liquid from his rectum while he was sleeping. It was night, no vets would still be open. So I read up a website, at which describes a condition of a kitten from its stool and urine's color and texture. I suspected that he might be suffering from food poisoning (the ikan goreng and the Dutch Lady milk). I was devastated thinking that Sim might not last that night as his body was so weak, his head just lolled if unsupported, his paws were almost cold, all the signs I though that he was really dying. I couldn't bear the thought of seeing him die all by myself as my husband was at work at that time. All I could do that night was rub him to keep him warm and pray that he'd be ok. I was already so smitten by this kitten, although we couldn't keep it, I really wanted it to live. Miraculously, my prayers were answered when Sim suddenly got up, eyes wide open and started roaming the room. I was like ""were you playing tricks on me?"". It was really miraculous! I couldn't explain it if it's actually normal but I was extremely grateful. I still am today. After the gruesome experience, we went the extra mile to look after him, like looking after a human baby. Brought him a proper food for kitten, took him to the vet when he didn't pee and poo one whole day. As it turns out, he was still too young to pee on his own, so whenever he wanted to pee, he would let out signs which I finally figured out that if when he is meowing but wanted neither food nor milk, I would put him in the shoebox, stimulate him and if he didn't resist, he would proceed to pee until he is done. At first I have mixed feelings about touching an animal at its genitals but after the first time and seeing how at ease he felt, it really made me feel like a momcat. In those six days we took care of him, we were quite surprised that a lot of people were asking for him from this advert. For that, thank you all for your interest, it really meant a lot to us. The morning before we gave him up, I decided to give him a little wash. As I know that all cats hate cold water, I bathed him in warm water and he LOVED it, didn't squirm, didn't kick around, didn't scratch me for putting him in such a spot! At one point, I thought he wanted to immerse himself in the water. Haha! And then I wrapped him up and he fell asleep again before I fed him one last time. Throughout the one hour journey to his new owner, Sim just slept away. We really think that he is so much like a human baby who would fall asleep in car rides because of the aircond and the feeling of the car moving. :) Sim Sim... After handing him over, the new owner has been keeping in touch with us to ask what should she do if Sim is giving certain signs. I felt a bit worried if Sim's signs were misread, and all those sort of stuff a mom would typically be worried of. Text messages from the new owner saying that he likes to climb on top of people and follow them around the house, all the things Sim did to us showed us that he is settled at his new home and his new family. I tell myself that he'll be alright. It's weird that I have kittens at my parents' place but none made me feel like Sim did. None made me feel so emotionally attached like Sim made me feel. Though he might not even know us, what more remember us, we pray that he'll grow happily and healthily. Thank you Sim for the wonderful experience you have given us.",b1c83d13b,4,1

I love snuggling up for cuddles and belly rubs. Canine buddies make me super happy, I really love to play! Like most of my ilk, I'm a clownish doofus ready to amuse you with my silly antics. I'm potty-trained on grass when outdoors and walk nicely on a leash. Please don't tie me up or confine me unnecessarily cos I will protest rather loudly and persistently. I have a major, MAJOR oral fixation and will chew anything and everything I can get my pearly white chompers on so I hope you'll be patient with me, pretty please? Other than my penchant for destruction (my nanny calls me T-Rex, teehee!) I'm a lovely boy who'd really like a permanent home to call my own. Please drop my nanny a message and make my day!"" To summarise, my nanny says: I'm ideal for homes that... - have the time and patience to train and supervise a chew-happy pup - have one or more friendly and playful dogs to keep my jolly self company - have a decent-sized chew-proof area to contain me when unsupervised - have humans that can provide me with lots of companionship - elderly folks, work-at-home folks, kids etc. and I'll be a happy chappy! I'm NOT ideal for homes that... - cannot tolerate destructive chewing. - leave me alone for long hours. You won't like what I get up to when bored! - have small, reactive dogs or other small animals. I sometimes get overexcited during play and go into prey mode - I'd prefer to avoid hurting little creatures please :) ================================================== Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover neutering cost. 4.

She loves running and playing with other dogs though at times she's a little over-friendly and hyper. A week ago, the fur on her paws started to shed and demodex attack is back. We spoke to the vet about it and vet says that it's most probably her immunity that is causing the growth of the demodex. She has been with the fosterer for 3 months but the fosterer has to move out from her current place and shift to another place where the new landlord doesn't allow any pets.

He is a perfect kitten - healthy, playful, friendly and eats with a big appetite. He enjoys hanging out with humans and seems to like smelly feet. He is, therefore often very close to your legs, so the adopter must be always careful to check where he is before stepping! Boots purrs loudly, but has a surprisingly soft and gentle meow even when he is yowling for his nom noms. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 18 June. * Vaccination has to be given when he gets bigger - when he reaches about 2-3 months old. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets quality fresh food so that his tuxedo coat looks like its made of satin and silk all the time. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life.

We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Molly (3yr, female, neutered mother of Zee) and nova (male, 4 months old). As for Zee, he is 2yr, male, spayed. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property.

They were born on 9th Dec . They will be up for adoption. My heart breaks to release them all. Since they were two months old, I slept with them every day until now. They are very close to me. Even I cried during writing this information. :'( But I cannot keep them all because I already have 11 cats for now. Due to limited space, this 4 baby is open for adoption. These cute baby should be an INDOOR cat only (I never let any of my cat out before, so they have not been expose to outdoor). Very sad to let them go actually~ Currently they are on Royal Canin for kitten. Let me tell you a little story about them. Miu Ciu, the youngest. Very naughty but spoiled. Have a short tail. The color is rather unique, where there are white, orange and cream colors. Oh yes, he likes to ""meow"" a lot. Small Black, the third born kitten. Look elegant and magnificent, probably because of its color. He is black and his hair is rather soft. His chest are white and also white-legged like wearing a socks. His eyes are always round as in ready for ""attacking"" mode. Orengy, second born kitten. A little careless and playful. His eyes were squinting. Long tail, orange tabby and white. The face looks confused, but also love to play. Lastly, Teleng. The first born kitten, getting severe flu when he was two months old, caused him a fever reaching 42 degrees celsius and even seizures. Now he's fully healed, but his head slightly tilted due to the fever. That's why he looks pretty cute with his shortcomings. Just like his brother, Teleng is black and white-legged. Anyone interested can contact me for pre-booking. This will also provide you some time to do the preparation before this two cute kitten come to your lovely home. I only prefer cat lover, if possible want them to be adopted as pair. Because I love to see them both together and they are very attached to each other.",bdb6ebb91,17,2

As you can see, he's only as big as a small cat... Please whatsapp or sms me at... I'm located at Jasmine Park, Taman Putri Kulai, Kulaijaya, Johor Yesterday morning, i was tending to my cats... It was around 7:45 AM... It was Monday, 12 January... I was outside the house at Jasmine Park, guarded area and have fences around the houses... I heard a screaming sound... I thought it was a cat screaming... But then my sister went to look for it and she saw a dog running scared in the middle of the street... On the main road (jalan besar) in front of my house... People were busy going to work, school... They tried to avoid hitting the dog... But i'm afraid something worse would happen.... Immediately i grabbed a pair of gloves and run to the main road... i caught the dog... Fortunately all cars were slowing down.. Probably because they saw me trying to save that dog... That dog was clean... No sign of it like it was a stray dog... Then i asked around... They saw someone, an Indian guy, with motorcycle, dump the dog near the main street... I got the dog safely to my house, put it in the cage... Just so you know, i'm a Malay... Have more than 23 cats in my care... I couldn't afford to care for a dog because of few difficulties..

She is a 6/7 months old female cat. We found the poor thing on the 1st of January in our garage. She was starving and was trying to get close to any cats or humans she would see. She was in a pretty good health then we understood that she got either lost or abandoned. The vet has confirmed that she had a family before as she is behaving like a house cat: friendly, cuddly, litter-trained and responsive to contacts. We dewormed her, neutered her, treated her against fleas and we made sure she regained the weight she lost. She is really easy to handle, didn’t complain when the vet checked her and when giving her treatment against worms. She got a flu but she is all clear from it since a month thanks to the proper medication. She is as perfect as she can be. She has a beautiful grey-orange colour and her eyes are bright orange. A gem! She also have some Singapura features. She won’t be a big cat (unless you ive her tons of food). She looooooves cuddles and to stick around her humans. Unfortunately for her, we already have 4 big cats and it is not enough attention to her taste. It is not fair for her as she is craving for attention and quality time with us. She loves cuddling up against our legs to have a nap. If you let her do it, she will spend the whole night against you and will follow you everywhere. She is not a kitten anymore but she has the same level of cuteness! We often rescue cats and find them a loving family. Sandy will probably be the most love-giving one we would have saved so far. As a cat rescuer, I will be careful to find the good match for her. She will be happy in a family, with or without other cats. We have a strict policy of NO caging. Please be aware that a cat is a long term engagement (a cat can live an average of 15 years). So if you think that Sandy is THE one, I will be happy to introduce her to you.",74d7a26bc,9,3

Got a friend to check him out while I rush to my appointment and he was not found. After 9 hours, passed by again and saw him at the exact same spot waiting. Once I stopped my car, he came towards me wagging his tail. I'm VERY sure this is a dumping case, because there is no strays around or pregnant female dogs at the nearest strays area. This is what humans are capable of. He is probably just 4 months old, don't even know what is going on or how to fend for himself. He has got dandruff all over his top fur. And he looks so hungry. We named him Leshem, meaning precious. Because life is precious no matter in which form. He has been treated at the vet, showered, dewormed and vaccinated. He is back home with us now while waiting for a forever home he can count on as family. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",7adf54516,7,3

I thought I would die no one cared. I was down to skin and bones, you could even see my hips and spine! She cried seeing me and alerted the fb community. My rescuers came the very next day all the way from KL to rescue me. Finally my prayers are answered! I'm better now but I understand they are active rescuers and need to rescue more pitiful neglected dogs.

I'm not able to talk but from the wag of my tail or big sunny smile you will know my deep love and gratitude. I'm good natured not rough, I don't bark unnecessarily and I'm gentle with children.

I am very handsome with a very long tail, I am charming, very affectionate and I love children. A funny thing happened one day ...... I went to my home but no-one was there!!! I saw a big truck and people putting things into it ... even my favourite couch!!!! I did not know what was happening. Everyday I went home and no-one was there, and boy was I getting hungry. I have been fed by my people since I was a baby kitten, I haven't learnt to find food for my self and all the neighbourhood toms kept picking on me, I'm a lover not a fighter!! Then I started getting itchy, very itchy, think I had a skin disease and it was getting very sore, and had lost so much weight. Thankfully one of my friends, Chica, took me to her home and her Mum gave me some food, oh it was so good! She took me to the vet too! I had a jab and the sore itchiness is getting better. Chica's Mum starting calling me Elroy, it's a good name for me. I understand it is hard for Chica's Mum to keep me and she is trying to find a new home for me, and I am grateful. The other day Chica's Mum took me back to the vet and I had a long sleep, when I woke up I was a bit tender in my private area, I think the vet took my things off!! But I don't mind, I'd much rather stay at home with my new family than roam the streets and get beaten up all the time.

Brother to Demetrius (Profile: ) ♥ This frisky chubby-cheeked lad loves to play! He is the more vocal one and will be the first to meow as you enter the house. He ""coo-s"" before making his dash anyplace and its the cutest thing to watch. ♥ He takes a few days to adjust to new environment but once adjusted, he becomes the extrovert! He adores people and knows how to speak (meow) back when spoken. ♥ This boy needs a little time to adjust around other cats (long as they are not aggressive his way, he'll take only a few days). He's as gentle as his brother and will not use claws harsly when playing with us. ♥ Floren is on the road to recovery from a mild skin issue he had post rescue and is otherwise a healthy boy. He has been dewormed, deflead and is very clever with the litter box. He prefers wet food over dry (although not a picky eater). ***PLEASE READ (Note for adopters)***: ○ Floren must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments need to be cat-safe. ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire to know more, this is for any cats long term welfare.

His owner although devastated never gave up on him. She provided everything she could so Angel can have a chance to live a normal life. Many would believe a dog born with such disabilities should be put to sleep. As the owner is working and fearing Angel may hurt herself, he is currently living in a cage 24 hours a day. The owner would like Angel to have a normal life running and playing around just like other dogs. We are now looking for a loving home for little Angel. It's our hope to find a owner who accept him with this disabilities and love him unconditionally so he can live life to the fullest. Our recommendation to potential adopters : a) Ask yourself the following questions : - Am I ready to be the owner of a blind dog. - Did I have the commitment needed? - Did I have the knowledge? - Did I have the right conditions in my home? - Most importantly, did I have the love in my heart to raise this dog? b) Allocate time so both yourself and Angel can understand each other. c) Provide time for training so Angel can recognise sounds. If you believe you can raise Angel and in return inspired others to care/raise blind puppies, please contact me for further details. “Blind Dogs See With Their Heart and Are Worth Loving”.",d596234fc,4,3
